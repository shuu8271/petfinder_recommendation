0,Young,Labrador Retriever,"Sweetie came into a Texas shelter as a stray. A volunteer immediately fell in love with her and knew this girl is really special. This is what she has to say about Sweetie: âSweetie absolutely radiates love. I started going to visit the shelter dogs in April of this year. In 8 months of visiting dogs on the weekend, I have never met one who has such an immediate calming effect. It is hard to put into words, but she immediately made me feel an overwhelming sense of peace and love. I am very determined to save this girl and believe she has very important work to do in this world. We will all be better off for helping this girl get out of the shelter, trust me.â

There was no way we could let a dog like Sweetie die! Sweetie loves everyone she meets and wants to be touching her person at all times. She quickly became a foster favorite as well. She is super easy, and she's house trained and crate trained. She is great with kids and other dogs. She likes to play with her ball . She knows how to use the doggy door. She had rather be with her person or as close as she can get! To know Sweetie is to love her !

In his past life, Gus lived harmoniously with another dog, a cat, and children, and he has met some new dog friends since.  And to top it all off, he has an endless repertoire of googly-eyed facial expressions and choral stylings that will keep you laughing!

This means we are rescuing in areas that we can make the biggest lifesaving impact. While we continue to help our local dogs and families in NY wanting to surrender their pets we are compelled to help the animals most in need from the highest kill rate shelters in the country and the highest statistic for strays. Hundreds and thousands of highly adoptable puppies and dogs are killed daily. Therefore the majority of our pets come from these areas. This means the cost of rescue is higher due to the high costs of vetting, boarding, and transport. Please note our adoption fees vary and are the most reliable source of revenue enabling us to continue our rescue efforts. Your adoption fees directly contribute to the rescue of these animals. Please see our website for information and an application to adopt or foster or volunteer for RHR. Adoption fees vary from $250 to $500 which includes a pets spay/neuter - Micro-chipping - current vaccinations - heartworm testing. We ask that adopters submit applications in advance to help facilitate the adoption process. Please note while you may not be sure what pet you are interested in if any your application will help us find you the perfect match.

Please note that the pups that you see in these pictures have been adopted. However we regularly rescue pups like these from India who are available for adoption in the US. We are looking for fosters or volunteers in New Jersey for our IN pups/dogs rescued from the streets of India. We need committed foster homes for our pups who will take care of them when they are in the U.S. till a forever home is found. We are also looking for volunteers who is willing to fly with the dogs. It is extremely expensive to fly the dogs solo from India to the U.S; however it is lot cheaper if you are flying with the dogs. If you are visiting Delhi (where we have foster homes) or surrounding cities in India and would like to help us rescue a pup or two from the streets by flying them with you back home to the U.S. please contact us. Please email Rescuewithoutborders@gmail.com for more information. More Information: Desi (Local) or IN (Indian Native) or Pariah Dog is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. Its truly a pure breed whose origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed 
We are very proud to be a Rescue without borders. So, what does it mean to be a rescue without borders? In the last 18 months we were able to rescue, rehabilitate and find homes for over 90 IN dogs in the U.S. and Canada. We rescue and adopt within the U.S. irrespective of state borders, but now you may be wondering, why India? Typically in India, dogs that are born on the streets are not kept as family pets. Most people cannot afford to keep a dog as a pet and those who do prefer a western breed as a status symbol. So these street dogs spend their entire lives on the streets in deplorable conditions. Most of the pups that are born on the streets will get killed by passing cars, or die of starvation or malnutrition. These dogs/ pups often become victims of cruelty as some people resort to cruel measures to get rid of them from their streets. The average life span of a dog living on the streets of India is 3 years during which time they continue to live starving miserable life full of abuse and suffering; however when these same dogs when given a chance to live in a home as family pets will live a healthy life of up to 16-18 years. That is why we rescue these dogs to give them an opportunity to be a part of a family and to live their life in a comfort and safety of a loving home. 
Please email Rescuewithoutborders@gmail.com for more information.

More Info on this breed --- Desi (Local) or IN (Indian Native) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, and thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domestic dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog. 
This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and is how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness. 
They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run. 
INDogs dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.  These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs. 
Desi dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.  A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 16 years. This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weight about 28-50 pounds (12 â 22 kgs). With pointed ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back, an IN Dog is similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian dingo.

Come and Get Your Love with Peter Quill! Pete was picked up as a stray and brought to Philly animal control, but managed to dance his way out of the shelter and into our hearts at City of Elderly Love!

According to his foster mom, you would never know this cool dude is estimated to be ten years old. Heâs the perfect mix of playful and obedient. Pete loves being active by going on walks to meet neighbors but also appreciates the simpler moments in life, like a good nap on his favorite pillow (hint: itâs all of them). He is funny and clever and will do anything to get his paws on his favorite KONG toys. He especially loves when theyâre filled with Honey Nut Cheerios and cream cheese!

PQ thrives on routine and has been doing a great job learning rules and boundaries since being in foster. He just wants to be included in whatever youâre doing. Pete is 100% trainable so heâs looking for someone who is able to put in time, attention, love to make him to be the best boy he can be!

38,Young,"Dachshund, Chihuahua","Marco came to NorthStar Pet Rescue in October 2017. He is currently our longest resident in foster and although he loves his foster home, a foster home is not a forever home.

Marco is a Chihuahua/Dachshund mix (often called a ""Chiweenie"") and is about 1.5 years old and weighs 12 pounds. He is playful, housetrained, and gets along with small dogs and cats.

This boy is very smart and eager to please his person.

Marco may take some time to warm up to strangers and large dogs, but given an opportunity to get to know them on his timeline, his confidence builds and ultimately he is fine. We have also discovered that he warms up more quickly to men than to women. Marcoâs perfect home would be with a single guy who is willing to work with him and his insecurities. Donât be deterred ladies, Marco is currently living with two women and adores them, but for some reason he really enjoys the company of men!

Marco has completed four weeks of a âboard and trainâ program and anyone who adopts him would have access to those trainers.

Could you be ""The Person"" that Marco is looking for? Please give this little guy with the big personality a chance. He'll win you over - Guaranteed !!

APARTMENT APPROPRIATE.

This handsome boy has a medium energy level and so much love to offer if you would only give him the chance. He exhibits some anxieties when inside the home and would prefer to live in a quieter area. Rowdy absolutely loves being outside or going for car rides. He would make the perfect companion for someone who likes to hike/walk, but would also be just as happy to have a fenced-in yard where he can lay in the sun and chew on his favorite stick. He can be very playful. Rowdy is house trained, knows basic commands and he also walks really well on a leash. He's a smart guy who can pick up on tricks quickly and is highly treat motivated - especially for peanut butter. He has such a big heart but his rough past has made him leery of strangers. He needs an experienced owner who is patient and willing to work at his pace. Once you earn his trust, he is the biggest love bug who enjoys cuddling in bed and following you around the house. He just wants to be by your side. He has been around small children (under the age of 5), but never unsupervised. He shows a lot of playful interest in other dogs but has only had supervised play because he's a rough and tumble kind of guy. He might benefit greatly from having another dog in the home.

To adopt Ellis please fill out an application at http://www.oneloveanimalrescue.org/adopt.html To be considered as this pet's adopter, please go to www.oneloveanimalrescue.org/adopt.html to complete your application.

A true Southern Gentleman, CALVIN is living hi sbest life with an awesome foster famliy in Pottstwon, PA, which inlcudes four other dogs he loves!  CALVIN has responded beautifully to training, consistency and structure, returning the favor with obedience, loyalty and love! It's not fair for CALVIN to be bonding with a family that isnât actually his...

Before he made his way to Mr. Bones & Co.'s rescue program in December 2016, CALVIN had been abandoned on the outskirts of Houston, TX and was living in a junk yard. Now 3 years old and 45lbs. CALVIN is all sorts of sweet, goofy, wiggly affection. He does well meeting new people and dogs and is house and crate trained. CALVIN is being fostered near Reading, PA and is available for meet and greets.

The ideal home for CALVIN will have a fenced in yard so he can get his ya-yas out, have active people who enjoy hiking, walking and being outdoors and who understand dogs need structure and consistency. He looks for a confident person on the other end of the leash and wants to take cues from his people!

We will consider a home for him in PA, NY, MD, DC, VA, WV, NJ, OH, DE so please help us make his holiday dreams come true. Apply online via www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt

In the 9 month since Happy has been in foster care she has blossomed into a sweet and very social people oriented dog. the best way to describe Happy is a very Happy dog  who loves to be around people but  not so much other dogs...Happy is housebroken, walks on lead easy going girl who is very quiet.

The sad news is hen we pulled Happy her blood work indicated Kidney disease. We were hoping this was more of a diet issue,  Being Happy was severely emaciated that once she was put on a good diet that the blood work would improve, sadly it did not . However one would  never know by the way she acts. Kidney disease ca be managed to some extent and progression slowed down. We are hoping Happy will have many more years, and it should be in her own home not in foster care.  

Happy has steadily gained weight on a home made kidney diet that is less expensive then most commercial foods. We are seeking a family that wants a great dog that has more to give then what we can do in foster care for Happy.

52,Adult,Poodle,"Say hello to Buddy!

This little poodle is approximately 8 years old.Â  Please read his story:

Buddy was found tied to a tree in Juniper Park, Middle Village, and taken in by our group.Â  This is one of the worst cases of neglect and abuse we have ever seen.

Buddy couldn't be touched due to the severity of the matting of his coat. At first, his sex couldn't even be determined. The pain and suffering this poor little dog has had to endure is simply unimaginable.Â  He was rushed to the vet where he had to be anesthetized, shaved down, and bathed.Â  He received extensive blood work and a dental procedure during which multiple teeth were removed.

With the love and patience being shown to him by our staff and volunteers,Â  Buddy has begun to feel like a dog again. This innocent little dog hasn't had an easy life but has found a SAFE haven with us.Â  Buddy will need a very kind and patient adopter who is willing to work with him to continue building up his confidence and trust.Â  He really needs a good friend and forever home...

Buddy likes other dogs.Â  You can meet this awesome little boy at our Atlas location, 80-36 Cooper Ave., Glendale.

Buddy will be neutered, microchipped and up to date on all vaccines upon adoption.

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

I like to carry the ball around in my mouth or do the same with my water dish. I am even bilingual â âHablas Espanol?â

I walk great on a leash and enjoy a nice stroll through the park. But I need to go to a home that has Pit Bull or bully breed experience. I need a home that will give me the time I need to get used to my new surroundings. But I am trying so hard to be a good boy, to be someone you would want to take into your home.

I am housebroken, which is good because I don't like to be crated. I like to go for a ride in the car â see all the photos of me catching a ride with my kennel buddies? Iâm a good listener, too, and they say Iâm smart â I just want you to be happy with me, if youâll just give me a chance. If youâve got the patience and the love and the right kind of home for me, I would be so grateful to you for giving me the chance to love you back.

If you think we would be a good match, please complete an application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to mention my name â ROSCO PITTY PUP. Iâll be right here waitingâ¦

65,Baby,American Staffordshire Terrier,"28 Sept. 2018: 

Remember the story of Eggo? This little peanut was found at 5 weeks old, weighing 2 pounds and severely malnourished. Although the odds were stacked against her, our Eggo survived and she is now a 28 pound happy puppy.

Eggo is finally ready to move to the next phase of her life. Because of the neglect she endured at a very early age, Eggo has a few quirks and she will need an understanding home that will help her and work with her. Specifically, Eggo continues to struggle with potty training and seems to have blurry vision. She is a bit protective of her food but is easily redirected. She has a short attention span and easily distracted (all those shiny objects!!!!) Eggo also enjoys running up and down the driveway as if it were her own personal treadmill. 

All in all Eggo is a joyful, silly, loving pup. She loves being rocked to sleep at nights, something her caretakers started those early nights when she was so critical. Eggo is content wherever you put her whether outside in her pen or inside in her Xpen at night. She never barks or tries to escape. Sheâs a happy pup all the time. We are looking for the perfect home for our miracle girl. She needs a home that will be both loving and firmâa home that will work with her and cherish lifeâs little victories.

If you are interested in a specific animal, please email info@evessanctuary.com with the name of the animal you are interested in written on the subject line. Please remember that ESAR requires a full complete application, an interview, and a home visit prior to final approval and placement of adopted animals.

67,Adult,Shih Tzu,"20 March 2018: Mireille is a seven year old Scottish Terrier mix who has endured years of abuse and neglect. When she first came into rescue, she was too weak to stand and could only move by dragging her back legs. She was severely malnourished, to the point that her ribs and hip bones jutted out. Because of the cruelty she lived through, she was very distrustful of people and didn't know how to accept love and human touch. Her fear of people would easily take over, causing her to react negatively. 

Mireille has been in foster now for 6 months, and she has finally learned to accept love and human touch. She follows her foster mom from room to room, snuggles in her lap, licks her nose and face, and lets her pick her up. She has gained eight pounds and is happy and healthy. She runs to greet her foster mom when she gets home. When her foster mom prepares her food, Mireille jumps into the air, unable to contain her excitement. This has earned her the nickname, ""little jumping bean."" It will be important for any prospective adopter to understand that Mireille will require punitive-free training and lots of patience. She will probably need time to decompress and have a safe space to which she can retreat. Her foster family leaves her play yard door open and she goes inside to her bed when she needs time alone. 

Mireille would do best with an experienced dog owner, who has time to take her for long walks or runs since she is much more relaxed and receptive to new experiences (such as haircuts and baths) after fresh air and exercise. She is still learning to love and to trust but with patience and time she will blossom. As her foster mom tells us, Mireille is a love.

Mireile presently lives with 3 other dogs and 3 humans. Please apply to adopt.",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41357710/1/?bust=1545216894'],Mireille,41357710,F,M,A
68,Adult,"Pit Bull Terrier, Labrador Retriever","One of the first things people ask about Bentley is âWhat kind of dog is that?â given his unusual looks, followed by âWhat a dog!â given his incredibly bubbly personality. Such a unique dog must have an equally unique story and Bentley is no exception! Bentleyâs story starts with him landing in a municipal shelter where this active and friendly dog had no outlet for his energy. He was then transferred to our partner organization, Save Our Strays, that saw the potential and drive in Bentley and started working towards getting him into a board and train facility that would benefit him. Thatâs where Adopt-A-Dog and Ernesto at DOGS 360 came in; to train and work with Bentley until we could find him a home. This program had Bentley working with both Ernesto and other dogs daily to help work on his manners and also provide much-needed socialization. The greatest boon is that this program was in a home environment, so Bentley is getting a foster experience while also becoming the dog we knew he could be.

Due to his stay at DOGS 360, Bentley has made great strides in his socialization skills as well as his manners. We learned that Bentley is a tug master who has plenty of canine friends. He is the ideal companion for a family that likes to be outdoors (he LOVES going for bike runs) and would be by your side on a hike. Bentleyâs ideal future family would learn all the training he has learned and continue to give Bentley the structure and consistency he needs to flourish. For that reason, we would love to see Bentley in a home with older kids that could learn his training alongside him. He is a friendly and goofy dog that is waiting to become your next family member, so why not come and meet him today? You canât say no to a face like that!

77,Adult,"Beagle, Pug","Meet Lucy, she is around 6 years old and 30lbs. Lucy is a sweet girl looking for an active family who has time to continue her training and provide her with all the exercise she needs.

Lucy loves to run and would do well in a home with a yard for her to frolic in or someone who enjoys long walks, frequently goes hiking and on daily runs. She also enjoys swimming. She loves to play with toys, enjoys chewing on large branches and sunbathing.

Lucy would thrive in a home with experienced dog owners who have no other dogs, or only very submissive dogs. Lucy is an anxious young lady, and occasionally that leads her to make some bad decisions. However, Lucy is happy when she is on a good schedule, with a family who understands the importance of doggie rules. Lucy doesnât want to deal with the pressures of being leader of the pack, it makes her nervous, but if she has to take over, she will!

Lucy is house trained, has an incredible amount of love to give, and always has time for a cuddle. Lucy has more energy than the typical 6 year old pooch, and will need physical and mental exercise to keep her happy. Lucy currently takes medication to help with her anxiety. By consulting with your vet or taking her to see an animal behaviorist, you may be able to find other ways to help her control her anxious side. Lucy also has IBD (Irritable Bowel Disorder) which means she can only eat prescription dog food, and although she cannot have table scraps, she is a big fan of carrots and lettuce!

Lucyâs anxiety means she can be easily startled, especially when sleeping. Lucy was recently surprised by her baby brother which resulted in her snapping at him. Although the bite was superficial, we advise that Lucy not be around young children or children who can not be responsible around this little lady.

If you think you can give Lucy all the love she deserves and would like to meet her, please go to Petstablished.com or follow the link below to complete an application to adopt.

79,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Meet Donnie!

Donnie is a 2-year-old GORGEOUS fella who was found as a stray and brought to Philly ACCT. In the shelter he did not do well and would shake profusely in his kennel out of fear.Â 

Since coming in to foster care with Bella-Reed, his true personality has shone through! He gets alongÂ fantastic with the resident female pitty.Â Donnie is super sweet and is great around children! He currently lives with an 8Â year old boy and they do well together. He does not, however, do well around cats due to a prey drive like a lot of dogs his breed so a home without cats is a must. We would also recommend no small dogs.Â 

Donnie was sadly adopted and returned twice to no fault of his own. In BOTH instances they expected Donnie to get along immediately with their resident dogsÂ after bringing him home in to a new environment with strange people and animals - the first time he was bit on the neck by the resident dog, and the second time he was too playful and would obsessively drink from their pool in the yard. Both times he was returned the following day.Â Donnie needs a home with people who are understanding he needs TIME TO ADJUST. We will continue to look for Donnie's forever!Â 

Meanwhile, Bella-Reed received a grant from the Petco Foundation Holiday Wishes program and have decided to send Donnie to a 3 week board & train at K9 Connection in Buffalo, NY to help him become an even better version of himself! He will be gone from Jan 7-26. While we are taking applications on him now, he will need to wait until he's done his training to go to his forever.

Donnie is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, 4dx heartworm tested (negative), dewormed, and on monthly heartworm prevention.

Her former family describes her as ""loving, likes to hug, very sweet, likes to kiss and cuddle and she loves kids"".","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43372936/1/?bust=1543074075', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43372936/2/?bust=1543074291']",Luckie,43372936,F,M,A

Say hello to Elvis, who may not pull off a white sequin jumpsuit the way Mr. Presley did, but is just as handsome and sure to steal your achey breaky heart. Just like The King, Elvis is all about LOVE. He is super kissy, cuddly, snuggly and quality time with his family gets him glowing. While he loves to be the main act, he is great with other friendly dogs but likes a proper introduction. No fangirling too fast. But we can't blame a dog for tryin', because just look at this adorable low rider! Elvis loves long walks and getting out into the world and while heâs sweet as can be, house broken and a great boy in the house he could use some work on his leash pulling. Heâs also SO happy to be out of the shelter heâs working on some separation anxiety when humans leave but getting better every day because his awesome foster family is letting him know heâs safe and that scary shelter is his past and his future is a forever family that will cherish this hunk and all the happiness he brings. Elvis is a man's kinda man, and loves to hang with the guys; give him football, some basketball and popcorn---he's all IN. However, he has been known to entertain the ladies. Itâs clear to say this guy is loving life and can make you laugh just by looking at that amazing mug. So come meet Elvis and heâll having you singing the Kingâs classic, âWise men say, only fools rush in, but I canât help falling in love with you.â We just know it! Elvis is an incredibly happy 3 year old, 68 pound pit bull mix, formerly known as Snow. He is neutered, up to date on shots and chipped.

Ready for  forever home in January !

It great that this little girlâs name is honey bunny because she is sweet as can be.  Officially listed as a beagle mix, at Wags we think this girl is just a 16 pound magnificent mutt.  She was adopted at a southern high kill and returned days later when a puppy was work. Wags stepped in and saved her when there was absolutely no place for her to go.  This sweet girl knows sit and shake, she is great in her crate(as long as you provide her a blanket and a toy) and so far seems house trained.  She loves people and other dogs and is very very treat motivated.  We kinda think this 5 month old cutie is as close to perfect as you can get. If you would like to learn more about her please contact her friends at Wags.

Honey Bunny H Wilson is vetted and vaccinated as age appropriate,including spay, and available for adoption through Wags Rescue and Referral.

NOTE FROM FOSTER:
 Okay everyone this is my foster trip!! Heâs looking for his forever family. Heâs about 5 years old and a hound mix with three legs. He is the sweetest boy I have ever met! Perfect amount of energy and is always so loving! He is great with cats, people and pigs! Please message me if youâre looking for an amazing companion or family dog!

10/8/18

Hereâs Trip!!!! This good ole boy  is a 5 year old  hound mix with a pleasant and loving personality! Heâs had his share of ups and downs and is a special needs boy.   An old injury and infection resulted in a back leg amputation for Trip, but he's doing well post-op and is adjusting to his circumstances like a true warrior. He is a laid back 50 pounder who is content sleeping on the sofa, or on his dog bed if you insist. . He does well in a crate but manages well outside of it. Trip gets along with other nice dogs.  He enjoys having his ears rubbed and being talked to. He understands every word he hears, but is always careful not to repeat it because he doesnât want anyone to this heâs a gossip.  Trip is fully vetted, including neuter.  He has been treated for heartworms and is feels like heâs earned a medal of honor for beating those creepers.  Trip has had a tough couple of years, but hopes now that heâs gotten to feel the love of his foster and has received medical attention, his furever family is the very next step.

110,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Spend some time with Nathan and youâll find yourself falling in love. While he can sometimes be scared of new people or places, he warms up quickly once he knows you are his friend. Heâll be bringing you one of his favorite toys to play with or trying to crawl into your lap for pets in no time. He does have a lot of energy and would enjoy a home who has time to play fetch with him or take him for long walks. He is also super smart and has learned many basic commands, is housebroken and really wants to please his people. He is treat and toy motivated and loves training. Nathan is also playful with other dogs but sometimes needs a slow intro. He is only two years old and has a high energy play style that some older or laid back dogs may not like. But generally once he is introduced properly, while he has lost of energy he also is very appropriate and play bows and rolls over on his back to make other dogs feel more comfortable.

Nathan came to us from a local shelter. He had been brought in by police after he was taken from his previous owner who kept him crated 24 hours a day with no food and water. He was underweight and understandably afraid of everything. Nathan has come such a long way showing how strong, forgiving and resilient he is. His ideal home would be in a quiet suburban or rural area as sometimes new things or loud noises still scare him. He would do best in a home with teens and up.

Nathan is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm negative. He is around two years old.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42878475/1/?bust=1538154603', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42878475/2/?bust=1538154606']",Nathan,42878475,M,M,A

So much prettier in person, this girl will steal your heart for sure. A must meet! (Fostered in PA) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application.

Iâm good with dogs, tend to bark at cats (sorry, not sorry!) and older kids that would welcome my laidback temperament. I am already house trained, crate trained, and leash trained. Although Iâm well behaved and low-key, donât be totally fooled because I always get excited for a nice stroll outside. I tend to be apprehensive and shy when first meeting new people, but once I get to know you, Iâm super sweet and have a lot of love to give.

Want to adopt me? Fill out our online adoption application by visiting our website: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

121,Adult,"Cattle Dog, Labrador Retriever","Bailey loves to chase a Frisbee but is just as content to watch a movie with you. Of course she will encourage you to share the popcorn with her because who doesn't love popcorn and a movie? She knows some basic commands and responds well to firm but loving handling. It has been a great partnership so far. She has taught us to pick up our socks off the floor because, if you don't, there is nothing more fun in her eyes than stealing them. She is not good with strangers and would need a quieter home and someone who will take the time to earn her trust. She should have a fenced in yard and a home with no children

By being patient and spending time with her, we have discovered a wonderful, loyal, and sometimes comical friend. Bailey will be a blessing and a gift and your best friend if you just give her a chance. Sometimes when she is sitting there with a glint in her eye and a smile on her face, we laugh and say, Do you think she is thinking ""I am faster than you... I am prettier than you... and I am smarter than you""? I for one am glad she doesn't play chess. I would hate for her to know that she is right.

Bailey is a fabulous dog and deserves a home of her very own. She is housebroken, crate trained, UTD on shots and spayed.

She must sit upright to eat food and wait upright for 10-15 minutes afterward in order to digest properly.  Purchase of a Bailey Chair is the demand but thereafter she does well with any food.  This is a relatively common condition found in German Shepherds but she needs a dedicated owner who is committed to managing the condition.  It is for life.  
While Pieâs brother turned out extra large Pie is on the smaller size of about 45 pounds but is till growing and filling out.  Pie is very smart, crate trained and knows basic commands.

Their owner entered hospice care and all of his sweet dogs needed to be rehomed. Most of his dogs found forever homes but his two seniors weren't so lucky! Extended friends and family did not think that Tucker and Precious were bonded because they were in a home with many other dogs. For the first few weeks, we had them in different foster homes but Precious was not doing well. We decided to bring Tucker for a visit to see if it would lift her spirits and they have been reunited ever since! As the months have gone by, Precious has become more confident and much more independent of Tucker but she still does regularly check in with him though out the day.

We have been working hard to get them healthy enough for adoption. They both had dental surgeries (Tucker's was extremely extensive) and are now recovered and ready to find their forever homes!  Tucker is approximately 16 years old and is in fairly good health. He has some typical old man grumpiness and likes to spend most of his day napping. He has limited vision and hearing, but he still comes running when dinner is ready. Tucker is pee pad trained and seems pretty content with that set up. He also requires help with stairs. Precious is approximately 10 years old and is far more active and has no health issues.  She loves going outside and hanging out with the other dogs in her foster home. She enjoys sleeping in bed and loves to devour pup cups from Starbucks!

133,Young,"Shar-Pei, Pit Bull Terrier","Here is some information on Riley from the Humane Society of Ocean City:

âRiley is a male Shar-pei/Pittie mix, Brindle-coated, 2 yrs old, with a snoot soft and mushy like a marshmallow! Confident, playful, outgoing, and attentive, Riley is a wonderful companion pooch who is full of energy, love, and snuggles.

He loves running in the yard playing fetch and tug, walks around the neighborhood, and snuggling on the couch with you. Riley is intelligentâhe learns fastâhighly trainable and already has good domestic social skills, walks good on-leash, and even knows a few tricks!

Riley has been through a few homes in his short life, as those were folks who were unable to meet his needs. Too often he was left in a crate all day (8-10 hrs/day) and again through all the night; as a result he gets highly stressed when confined. He has NOT shown separation anxiety behaviorsâhe just hates being stuck in a crate away from everyone.

Riley is looking for a home where he can have plenty of attention, rarely to be left alone and stuck in a box. He needs good exercise/play time as he is young and energetic; he is an attention hound, and craves your company more than anythingâexcept perhaps nom-noms!

134,Senior,Chihuahua,"Ralph is a senior chihuahua that we rescued from Hempstead Shelter. He and his sister Rita were found and brought into the shelter.  They were so sad while there and clearly needed TLC, having been neglected and we believe dumped in the street.

Ralph is a 7 lb loverboy, and he and his sister crave human attention.

They have been fully vetted and are now ready for their home.  They must go to the same forever home since they are bonded.

Ralph can remain a foster while Rita can be adopted.  Ralph is on heart medication which we will cover.  He also has bladder stones that may cause him to have urinary issues.  He is not a candidate for surgery.  We will cover his medical care for life.

Please open your heart and home for Ralph and Rita!

Along with a horrible case  of alopecia, he was covered in fleas which, as you can imagine, is incredibly uncomfortable. Alfred was immediately bathed with a medicated shampoo and he actually seemed to enjoy the warm water running over his body! Alfred was reclaimed by his family and was reunited with the children who loved him so much, but he once again got loose and we received no word that the family wanted this sweet boy to come back home. So here he is with us! And we do love our Alfred!

Alfred is currently on medication for his skin, and still taking his medicated  baths, and we are seeing steady improvement in his condition. He unfortunately won't grow a lot of his hair back. He is just looking for someone to love him and see past his unique appearance. With his treatments in foster, he has had such a significant improvement, but will require regular medical care.

152,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"12 Photos Â· Updated 3 years ago
Queens, NY - ****Update: 12/3/17**** Freddy is now staying at a vet hospital while we look for a foster home for him. Here is what his advocate and sponsor had to say about him : ""I managed to arrive a couple of minutes before Mathew brought Frodo in. He immediately made himself at home: jumping at everybody and kissing everybody. He is extremely outgoing, friendly and sweet dog. He came with scratched nose and sides of lips. I could lift him, hold him, put ointment on the scratches. He is very young and has a lot of energy of course. Thus I had to steady him by holding his muzzle to put ointment on â no problem at all. His accommodations are very good: the hospital is very warm, he has separate room with huge crate (good enough for a Great Dane), I provided two comforters, two soft wide collers, two leashes, a sweater and a coat. There are other animals in the hospital overnight too. I walked him longer than an hour yesterday night and today morning. We will continue this schedule of walking. I am taking it easy: he learned âwaitâ quickly so I can pick his poop up and let cars and people pass (not so many in this area). Making him walk together with me will be of course harder job. I do not request for dogs to truly heal but they should not ever be in front or in back of me â we should walk together side by side with them sniffing and etc. I will have pictures taken during the week-end: too much going on now. There is a possibility of foster round the corner from me. But I am taking everything one step at a time. The hospital personnel is very compassionate and experienced with rescue. They loved him from the first sight. They will take good care of him for now. I think he will get a lot of attention and will be much happier there. He is very small and I think he is a pedigree: a true pit with stance and body type â just miniature. I have seen some like that: the owners told me that they are called âBulli pitsâ. I will check it out."" Stay tuned for more on Freddy Frodo! A volunteer writes: Hello up there, new human friend! My nameâs Frodo, this is my chew toy, and weâre on the hunt for an adventureâ¦wanna come with me? Iâm a lot like that other Frodo you know, pint-sized, innocent and true of heart, I even have furry feet like him! My whole outlook on life is can-do and I donât have a beef with anyone. See how I meet passing people and dogs with tail wags and a wigglebutt? Thatâs just me being me, I am full of love! Iâm also full of energy and nothing makes me happier than getting my zoomie on in the yard, playing fetch or just running around with my peeps. I never guard my things, though I play a pretty good game of tug-o-war, and I always keep my mouth what they call âsoftâ so no one gets hurtânot even the toys! Cuddles are cool too and if you try to kiss me, guess what? Iâm gonna kiss you right back. So whaddya say? You, me, my chew toy and endless adventures full of snuggles and fun?

154,Young,Chihuahua,"Tacoâs Woof-Facts

Male, Chihuahua, 2 years old, 7 lbs

Kisses and tail wags, oh boy â dame un beso!

Sweetie pie, enjoys being held, sitting on your lap and playtime

Gets along fabulously with other dogs, especially loves his dear canine friend, Daisy

Crate trained; good doggie manners, walks well on a leash

Quick Introduction to Taco

Hola! Iâm Taco, and my name has a story behind it: I was rescued on National Taco Day, and for me, that was the best day ever! Also, did you know that the Chihuahua
is the smallest breed of dog and is named after a state in Mexico? Therefore, youâll hear me say some words in Spanish as I tell you about myself. I promise, none of these things Iâve just mentioned have a
nything to do with the Chihuahua who starred in the Taco Bell commercials â we are not related (although, I have to admit, he is quite as adorable as I am). Iâm an active, little tyke â who loves to play, give kisses, be held, and find a spot right on your lap when weâre taking a siesta together. My tail is always wagging in an effort to show you how happy I am. Iâm crate-trained, and it only takes me a few minutes to settle in before I sleep right through the night like an angel. I get along great with all the other dogs, and I have an extra-special BFF named Daisy, who is my canine sibling (we are not blood related, but we are siblings in all other ways, through and through). I have good house manners, have gone through obedience training, and have learned how to make my little legs strut my stuff while walking on a leash with the grace of a salsa dancer. Iâm the kind of doggie who aims to please, so I make it a point to excel in all these areas. Please read on so you can learn more about me â your potential muchachito!

Tacoâs Background

About a year ago, somehow I became a stray and was on the streets all alone. I ended up walking into a hair salon of all places at an attempt to get off the streets and find help. It was a great strategy because thatâs when Rescue Haven was contacted, and I soon became a foster dog in their rescue group. I was quickly adopted and was living in a home with another doggie named Daisy (sheâs my bestie who I told you about). We thought all was going well, until, unbeknownst to us, something happened to our family structure. Then to our surprise, Daisy and I were returned to Rescue Haven â due to no fault of our own, I will emphasize â which leaves us looking for a new family. And this time, we want to make sure that we find our true âforeverâ family. And mark my words, Iâll look forward to celebrating National Taco Day each year with my forever family as well tell each other âYo Quiero Muchoâ!

Tacoâs Forever Home

After reading this, Iâm sure youâre just as excited about National Taco Day as I am, since now you understand why thatâs such an important milestone in my life! Iâll be great company for many types of people and households. I can sit on your lap while weâre watching TV, give you kisses, wag my tail, and, without a doubt, go with you on walks as I show you my smooth salsa moves. And if you are ready for double the fun, you can adopt my bestie Daisy too, so we can stay together forever. Then we can play, play; love, love, rest, rest play, play, love, love, rest, rest, and repeat, repeat!

Please fill out an adoption application with Rescue Haven and make sure to tell themâ¦ Yo Quiero Taco! And donât forget about my BFF, Daisy! I love her mucho!

I was rescued from the side of the road in Puerto Rico where people drive too fast.  The road is at the edge of El Yunque and it's in the jungle where dogs are dumped, hit by cars and killed there all the time.  His rescuer fed him some food on the side of the road and he would not let go of his leg and stayed in the street til his rescuer took him. My rescuer loved and cared for me until I was ready to take my liberation flight.

156,Adult,"Hound, Labrador Retriever","11/23/18

So I would love to share with you about this sweet boy.  Although he had a rough start, he truly has acclimated very well in his current foster home.  He truly thinks he belongs in our pack.  He is dog friendly, loves to play, and occasionally loves to carry around my shoes.  He truly makes me giggle.  He loves his dog bed, is house trained, enjoys taking walks and loves his toys.  He still has sparse hair on certain parts of his body, but after many vet appointments I believe this will be the best he will be.  

Although it will make me cry when he leaves, he is now ready to find a home that he can call his own and be spoiled and loved like he truly deserves.

167,Senior,Poodle,"Blind Dog Rescue Alliance will transport within reasonable distance. Dahlia is being fostered in VA.
Dahlia was a stray in western Virginia and ended up in a shelter. The shelter contacted the Blind Dog Rescue, and Dahlia was brought to her Virginia BDRA foster home.

Dahlia (Dally) is an 8 pound apricot poodle. Because she was a stray, her age is unknown, so the vet took a guess, and said maybe she is as young as ten, maybe as old as fifteen. Dally has no teeth, and is blind, due to a cataract, in one eye. She has some vision in the other eye, where there is also a cataract. Currently she needs no eye medication. She can hear very very little. She had an ear infection when she first arrived but that was treated and her ears are better. She has tested positive for Lyme and was prescribed a month of Doxycycline. She has many little lumps and bumps on her body, as old poodles tend to have, and they are itchy to her. She has started on a trial of Apoquel to see if that helps her out. She also has a sinus arrhythmia. In addition, she has a fistula in her mouth, and it has likely been there for a long time. Currently that is being checked out, and decisions will be made soon about what to do; a fistula can cause food to go up into the sinus area, and that causes trouble. Dally likes to eat, but does a lot of sneezing and rubbing and scratching after she eats, indicating discomfort.

Dally arrived at her foster home seemingly unaware of what housetraining was all about. She has improved, although is still not reliable, so she wears a diaper at times in her foster home. She walks pretty well on a leash, and enjoys being outside. She gets along with the other dogs in the house, and loves attention from her foster parents. She is a good eater and settles into a crate at night to sleep.
As with all dogs, Dally needs close supervision if young children are around.

With most any rescue dog, the past history is unknown so the future cannot be predicted. What is known is Dahlia is very deserving of lots of love and care! Please consider adopting Dally once her medical hold is over! 
Blind Dog Rescue Alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42705798/1/?bust=1536444812', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42705798/2/?bust=1536444818', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42705798/3/?bust=1536444825']",Dahlia: on hold (VA),42705798,F,S,A

Here is what her owner says about her: Nova is kind and friendly to everyone she meets, dogs and people alike. She is housebroken, knows commands such as: Sit, paw, other paw, down. Nova currently lives in a house with a two year old and five year old and those are her best friends. Nova is a great dog but an even better friend - she loves cuddles and being talked to like a little baby.

Nova turned a year old on 10/5/2017. She's an energetic pup who loves nothing more than a good old squeaky ball. On summer days Nova enjoys playing with the hoses, going for a swim, nice long walks, playing with a frisbee, going to the park meeting new friends and getting the zoomies out. She'd love to be part of an active family with or without children - she sounds perfect for just about any household!

Nova is NOT with Eleventh Hour Rescue but we are helping her owner to rehome her privately. If you would like to meet this special girl, please contact Donnei at 908-986-6524 or donnei0519@gmail.com","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40972728/1/?bust=1534743378', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40972728/2/?bust=1534743394', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40972728/3/?bust=1534743400']","XP Nova - Elizabeth, NJ",40972728,F,M,A

http://www.nyabandonedangels.com/adopt-or-foster-application. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!

SHELTER NOTES:

3/28/18: Don remains easy to handle during our sessions. He is easy to rope and bring out to the pens. He is soft and social during the interactions. He takes treats gently and shows a brief interest in tennis balls. He did balk at the rope but otherwise easily roped and returned to his kennel. -MC

3/26/18: Don was sitting at the front of his kennel when I approached. He stood up while I was unlocking the kennel door. Don was easily roped and lead into the SAFER room. Once in the room Don was easily leashed and unroped. Once off the rope Don immediately began exploring the room. Intermittently Don would approach me or my coworker and solicit attention by jumping onto our legs or giving kisses. Towards the end of the session Don was spending more and more time sitting or laying next to me and allowing me to pet his head and back. Don did not whine or shake the entire session. His body was loose and his mouth was mostly closed with a long lip. At the end of his session Don was easily unleashed, roped, and returned to his kennel. -JN

3/25/18: There is no significant changes with Don. In fact our session today was almost identical to yesterday's. He was less anxious and did not whine, but he did begin trembling at the very end of the session. I am conflicted if it was out of nervousness or if he was cold. I was petting him to the point where he was very relaxed and closing his eyes right before he began trembling, so I think it was most likely that he was just cold. This was also the only time he solicited attention from me during the session. Otherwise, he kept to himself and had a loose body and relaxed ears. He did at one point have his tail tucked, but very lightly. He also remained easy to re-rope, remove the drag, and return to his kennel.-MB

3/24/18: Don was sitting at the front of his kennel as I approached. He remains easy to rope, remove, and bring outside. He also gives no difficulty with attaching a drag leash. Once in the pens, as usual, he went straight to the last pen. He briefly sniffed around and then relived himself. He stayed in the 4th pen for the whole session, except to briefly step over the threshold. In the beginning he had a loose body and open mouth. After he relieved himself he began pacing in the pen, looking out towards the street. At this time a fellow employee was leaving the parking lot to walk a new arrival. Don went to the corner of the pen closest to where the other dog was. He then began whining and anxiously barking. Even after the other dog was out of view he sat down and stared at the street. I then noticed that he had begun trembling. I sat down next to him and began to pet him softly. He continued to tremble and would only stop briefly when startled by any noise. After a few minutes, he remained in the same position and continued trembling. I decided to end the session and began grabbing my rope, etc. At this point he walked over to me and I bent down and started petting him. He stood there and allowed me to pet him, while he closed his eyes and leaned into me. Since he seemed to enjoy it I continued for a bit. Then he got distracted and began going back to the corner of the 4th pen. I ended the session, and removed the drag, roped him, and brought him back with no problem.",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41320082/1/?bust=1522790253'],Donnie,41320082,M,M,A

178,Young,"Shepherd, American Staffordshire Terrier","Meet Kaos!

Kaos is a beautiful shepherd and staffy mix who was rescued from a kill shelter in south Louisiana. She was a high heartworm positive but has completed treatment and is now ready to find her forever family!

Kaos has severe separation anxiety but is getting better. She CANNOT be crated but can be left in a room if needed. She has some resource guarding from life on the streets so would need to be fed separately. Treats and bones should probably also be given separately. 

Kaos is great with other dogs and cats and is very low key. She likes to spend time with her foster momma and is a bit of a Velcro dog. We think she would make a great therapy dog who could visit hospitals and nursing homes.

192,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"People loving (good with strangers) and well mannered 4-year-old American Stafford Mix looking for her FOREVER home to snuggle in front of the fire with you.   A true!!! cuddle bug.

This great dog has just been named the ""Official Face of Dog Fighting Awareness"" for the State of NJ.  We rescued her from a dog fighter using her for bait. She wouldn't fight back so they dumped her!

She is housebroken, crate trained, doesn't jump, dig or chew (except sticks).  Sweet Pea is very very low maintenance but because she is low and stocky with a powerful body like a bowling ball, she can be too much for toddlers and they could be knocked over.  

She enjoys water: REALLY ENJOYS SWIMMING!! in a lake or pool. 

If you are looking for a walking partner she is also excellent on leash. Also loves the car.
. 
Fenced yard required for adoption. No electric fences or ""dog pens"".  If you are a renter or part of an HOA, we require written permission from landlord and/or HOA to have a ""pittie"" type dog.

Knows basic commands, sit, down, paw, stay

193,Young,"Rottweiler, Labrador Retriever","Our very special 10 month old lab/Rottie mix Kelly was trapped  after spending her whole life outside as a ""guard dog"" and roaming the streets of a local inner city with her brother.  She was never touched or socialized- her only human contact has been her ""owners"" tossing dog food on the ground out the back door of the house and she would jump their fence and roam the streets daily.  When we heard their story we knew she and her brother were just the type of challenge we love to work with @ Second Chance Pet Adoption League and we agreed to take them in if and when the dedicated volunteers that brought their story to our attention could trap them.  Kelly was so hungry she went right in the trap as soon as it was set, and we are hoping her brother will be safe with us soon as well.  Kelly is scared and shut down and doesn't know how to bond to people at this point but is getting a little more comfortable each day with the help of her doggie friends in her foster home.  She LOVES to play with other dogs and comes alive in their presence and will need a multi-dog home. Kelly will be  looking for a very special person to prove themselves worthy of her trust- could it be you?  Email njwoof@cs.com if you are interested.  .We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East next to 5 Star Car Wash (formerly Boulder Car Wash) in Morris Plains (Denville on GPS).

195,Adult,Poodle,"Say Hello to Parker!  Parker is an estimated 8 year old Poodle  or Poodle Mix, who came into Bichon Rescue because heâs little, white and has curly hair.  When he arrive at his foster home, his foster mom immediately recognized that little docked Poodle tail which didnât stop wagging, despite his deplorable condition.

Parker was found on the streets of Brooklyn as a stray.  He was filthy, horribly matted and his breath would knock you over.  Luckily for Parker, Bichon Rescue of NNJ was contacted by the NYC Animal Control to see if we could help him.  We instantly said, âYes!â  

Parker arrived in his foster home on December 3rd and he immediately got booked for a spa treatment.  After he was freshly groomed, he went to the vet for a check up, blood work and to schedule a dental and neuter.  He was cleared for surgery and had both procedures on December 10th.  Poor Parker lost quite a few teeth, but his breath is sweet again and his tail is still wagging.  He is also eating like a trouper, although seems to prefer chicken over dog food.

Parkerâs left eye has a cataract, but he can see just fine as his right eye is in excellent shape, but both should be monitored over the course of his life.  Itâs an easy eye test which can be done in minutes during his regular vet exam.

Parker is mostly a quiet dog who is friendly to both people and other dogs.  He is slightly shy, but quickly warms up once he knows heâs going to get petted or get treats.  He has been through a lot in the last month, so his house-training skills will need to be reinforced, but heâs doing very well at his foster home when taken out regularly.  Parker walks nicely on a leash and is also very good in the car.  Heâs patient while his foster mom runs errands and relaxes in his own special doggie car seat.  Parker is an all around easy going dog; affectionate, but not needy.  He would be fine as a single dog or a nice addition as a playmate.  Have an open lap and heart this Holiday Season? Ask for Parker!

This lovely hound mix is about 7 months old, 35 lbs, and a little bit of a nervous nelly in the city but charms the socks off of everyone she meets. Caraway is a super smart fast learner, excited to meet new friends at every turn, will probably be in the 40s weight wise full grown, and needs to be in an active home ideally with another dog to play with and to guide the way. Her foster mom says: âCaraway is a sweet energetic puppy. She was very nervous when she left her last foster parent, but she settled in immediately at our home. She befriended our big dog, Bronx, and they have been the best of buddies. She had some bad habits like counter surfing that we are working on, and she is about 90% potty trained. She has learned to sit, stay, come, and working on retrieving. She has learned to sit and wait for her breakfast and dinner. She will wait for food until released with the word 'free.' It has been helpful for her to learn by watching Bronx, as he is well trained. She is very curious around our cat, Lila. I hope to get a photo of the two of them soon. She has some separation issues at the moment but I think that with time she will feel more secure. She is crate trained at night to sleep. She loves to cuddle and will fall asleep almost immediately. She spent the Thanksgiving holidays with us and was affectionate with everyone who visited. She loves to be picked up for some reason and cuddled but I try not to make a habit of it. She is going to make a family really happy.â Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org!

Norlina is still searching for her forever home.  At approximately 5 Â½ years old, this cuddle bug is a perfect family dog- she is house trained and roams her foster home all day without being crated.  Norlina is not a fan of small dogs, cats, or other dogs that jump on her.  She enjoys the laid-back couch cuddling lifestyle with the occasional game of tug-o-war.  She is a little shy at first but opens up within the first few minutes.  She would make a great fit for a family with children of all ages because she NEVER jumps on anyone and likes to snuggle up on the couch.

Norlina would love to find her forever home for the new year J If you have any questions about this pretty pittie princess, her foster is happy to answer them.

Norlina here for another update!  My foster Mom says Iâm a total cuddle bug- but I donât understandâ¦ I thought I was a dog??  When we are inside I like to cuddle, play tug-o-war with my furry foster sister, and chew on my toys.  My foster Mom says I follow her around a lot, but thatâs just because Iâm really interested in whatâs going on and I like to be involved!  When we go outside I know that means I go potty and I recently learned that I like the snow!  My current neighbor has an outdoor cat and sometimes I try to chase him but thatâs just because I want to have more furry friendsâ¦  Hopefully my next home doesnât have any small dogs or cats.  I do LOVE small humans though!  My foster Mom always says Iâm a good girl indoors and outdoors, so she lets me stay out of my crate when she goes to work.  I like to greet everyone who comes in our door with my wiggle but and I NEVER jump on new guests.  Come meet me at an adoption event or contact WAGS rescue to set up a meet and greet!  Applicants must meet bully breed criteria (homeowner with a canine vet reference, bully breed experience preferred).

Hi! Norlina here! Or as my foster mom calls me âperfect pittie princess!â  In normal pittie fashion- I like to be with the humans. Sometimes we cuddle, sometimes we play, and sometimes they take me for car rides.  I have fun with all the humans (big & small) and I like to play with other dogs. My foster Mom keeps reminding me that Iâm not suppose to chase the neighborâs outdoor cat, but it seems like a fun game to me! I get really excited when I see my leash because that means it time to go outside!  I really like it outside when itâs sunny; Iâm not a big fan of the rain though. I like to be inside too because that usually means cuddling!  Since Iâm house broken and so well behaved, Iâm allowed to stay out of the crate all day and night. I spend most of my day looking out the window keeping watch on the neighborhood and my night cuddling with my foster sister without getting up.



The cool ladies at the vet give me treats and say Iâm pretty.  They also said Iâm spayed, vetted and vaccinated as age appropriate and available for adoption through Wags Rescue and Referral but BULLY CRITERIA applies.

Norlina is a 5 year old spayed pittie mix that weighs about 55 pounds. Norlina came to wags after volunteers found her injured in a southern high kill shelter. The shelter was full and Norlina was out of time, the rescue got her to the vet and this beautiful girl was quickly on her road to recovery.  She has spent everyday since proving what a treasure she is. A happy girl who adores people, Norlina wants nothing more than to be close to her people. It doesnât matter to her if you want to go for a long walk, play outside or just hang out on the couch and watch TV she is ready to be your partner. She is great in a crate and with supervision she has been good in the House.  Norlina is dog friendly but will be perfectly happy to be your one and only too.

211,Adult,Irish Terrier,"Please help Donegal overcome his loss by giving him a good home. This little scruffmuffin is a black Irish Terrier, 7 years old, weighing 16 pounds. He lived with an older man who recently died of cancer. Donegal has been well taken care of and is up to date on vaccinations. He is also neutered.

Donegal is very playful and definitely a lapdog! He gets along fine with female dogs but not with my older male unneutered dog. He loves going to the groomer and the vet simply because he likes the attention. And of course the pet store is a favorite place to visit!

Donegal is housetrained, he has never had an accident in my house and you can put him in a crate for hours without any issues. He loves car rides and you can trust him in the car if you leave him to go on an errand in a store. He is very good and does not get into anything (although I would not trust him with food).

Donegal loves toys and it is fun to play with him with them. He is not possessive with his food bowl and you can take it away from him while he is eating. Leash is another story. He gets SO excited when he thinks he is going for a walk (we need some work there) but he is fine once you get out the door. He is like a bouncing ball when he knows he is going for a walk. He is full of energy and behaves like a puppy, he even walks like a puppy. But if you want to cuddle he is up for that too.

I'm not sure he has ever been around children. The best home for him would be with someone who can give him lots of attention & he will love them sooo much in return! Donegal is a sweet dog who deserves a good home. Anything you can do to help me find one will be appreciated.

Donegal is NOT with Eleventh Hour Rescue but they are helping with the rehoming process.

Introducing Doobie!!!! Doobie is a 3 year old 47 lbs Boxer/Pit mix with a sweetheart of a personality! Like many others, he was a victim of Hurricane Florence but he is turning this into his personal victory story. . He is a high energy fellow who loves to run and play, but with adequate exercise, he settles nicely in his crate and is very well behaved. He is potty-trained, at least at his foster's house he has not experienced any accidents. He's not a chewer and sees to do well with the foster's other dogs. He is ""intrigued"" by anything that gets easily spooked and will attempt to chase squirrels or cats who are generally afraid of a dog. Doobie needs a little work with leash walking due to his impulsive nature so a handler with experience would be best suited for him. He  is fully vetted, including neuter. He has been treated for heartworms.  He promises to be a faithful companion to his new family and will roll over every chance he gets for a great belly rub.  If you are interested in adopting Doobie, visit www.wagsrescue.com and complete an application. Doobieâs foster is happy to answer additional questions for an approved adopter.

If you are looking for a ray of sunshine on these dark nights and cold morning well do we have the dog for you. Meet our little boy Jayden! All the way from Korea. Saved from the Korean meat trade and flown all the way here to N.J. for a new life with you. He is fully grown. Somewhere between one and two years old. He weighs in at a whole 7lbs! He loves everyone. Does well on a leash. Jayden is house trained and is good with cats kids and other dogs. And has the confidence of a lion not a lamb. He is crate and pen trained and we accepting applications. 

We work closely with a Korean based rescue called. Passion for Compassion. They kindly allow us to help them rescue these poor babies. These dogs are meat trade dogs. The bigger ones are used for meat and the small breed dogs are throw away dogs from the wealthy as a new breed becomes more fashionable to own. These little ones are boiled alive and made into an elixir which is believed to have health qualities. It is extremely expensive to bring the Korean dogs to safety with flights around 3 to 400 dollars alone. We then obviously have to spay or neuter and microchip and provide shots and health certifications. This all has a knock on effect to you when it comes to fees. We hope you understand. Any monies we raise go right back into making a difference and saving more lives.

224,Adult,"Dachshund, Chihuahua","Dexter is an adult male black and tan ""Chiweenie"" (Chihuahua &Â DachshundÂ mixed-breed) born 9/21/2008. He came to our rescue from a high kill shelter and was saved from being euthanized. He is a small dog and weighs about 18 pounds. Dexter looks more like a Dachshund, but has longer legs. He is current on vaccinations, neutered, on monthly flea/tick and preventative, and microchipped.Â 

Dexter is playful and affectionate with people he knows and trusts, but he is very fearful of strangers, particularly men. He can be very reactive when he sees people or other dogs he doesn't know while out on a walk. If he feels threatened he gets defensive. However, if allowed to meet new people on his own terms he is much more accepting. He probably didn't receive much socialization as a young dog and as a result is fearful of strangers - both human and canine. We feel he would do best as the only pet in the home.Â 

Dexter will need an experienced adopter that understands his special needs and is willing to continue working on socializing him while providing a stable environment. An adult-only home would be ideal. Prior experience with Dachshunds or Chihuahuas and their temperaments is preferred. 

He's an affectionate and playful dog that will require plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation to give him positive outlets for all his energy. Being home alone in a crate all day would NOT be a suitable environment for Dexter. He is crate trained but needs frequent opportunities to go outside to potty during the day, although he is fine in his crate overnight.  Dexter is a very sweet boy that would be a very loyal and lovable companion for the right person.

IMPORTANT: Safe Hounds Beagle Rescue does not operate a shelter where the public can meet our dogs. All of our Beagles are cared for in a loving foster home. Prospective adopters must submit an adoption application and be pre-approved to adopt. Once an applicant is approved, weâll begin a matching processâthe right dog for the right home.

She weighs about 45 pounds and is believed to be about 2 to 3 years old. Tappie is crate trained, house trained and has learned âsitâ and âdownâ.

Tapestry is very picky about who her doggie playmates are. She seems to prefer females that are her size or a little smaller. Tappie is full of energy and rightfully so at her young age, so someone that likes going for long walks, hikes or jogs would be a great match for her.

He is a smart dog that needs a job of some sort - a hiking companion, jogging buddy, or being one of the 'guys'. Boomer is respectful of his handler, he is healthy, strong, clean and playful. The fact that Boomer is part American Staffordshire Terrier makes it difficult for him and others like him. The restrictions are pretty clear: Boomer is a little too interested in cats and other dogs, so his new home should be feline and canine-free. And because heâs a young guy â about five â with lots of energy we are hoping to send him home with âa calm, experienced owner that can make his life predictable and keep him busy.' He needs a family with older children (teens) or just adults and no other 4 legged pets.In an effort to find that special someone, Boomer's good behavior at the vet, in the kennel and with his handler excels. He has the propensity for being ridiculously happy when heâs outside playing and burning his energy up. Remember a good dog is a tired dog!And if this post seems a little more hostage-like than the more cheerful adoption promos â well, itâs just one more effort to get one of AFEW's long-term residents his own family, at last. âHe has waited a long time and we would love to see him finally get his forever home. As anyone who works in rescue will tell you, it is never sad when our animals go home. It is only sad when week after week they patiently wait and seem invisible to adopters and come to think of their kennel as home.â*Per JSAC policy, puppies and kittens under 6 months will not be adopted to families with children under the age of 6 years.",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43119889/1/?bust=1540666517'],Boomer **COURTESY POST&quot;,43119889,M,L,A
231,Young,Beagle,"Maize is an adorable 1 yr old Beagle mix. She has the characteristics of a Beagle but the markings of an Australian Cattle Dog. She is UTD on shots, spayed and ready for her furever home. Maize is very playful and likes the game of fetch. She will bring the ball back to you, plays with her toys and she sleeps thru the night. She is fully house trained and will go to the door and dance when she needs to go outside. She is crate trained and currently sleeps in it at night. She knows Sit, Leave it and Gentle. While she enjoys the company of dogs, cats are not her friend. She would be best in a home without cats. Maize is still learning her manners around children and would be best suited with kids over 5 years or older. She is a total love bug.  If you are interested in Maize, please call and leave a number at 484-323-1134, email for more information at pldpaws@gmail.com or fill out an application online at www.pldpaws.org.

232,Young,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Gator is a male Blue-nose American Staffordshire Terrier who is ~2 years old. Weighing nearly 80 lbs he is a large fellow with a heart as big as he is! He was abandoned by his previous owner after they were evicted. He is a sweet boy who loves spending time with you, doing pretty much anything. He enjoys walking the neighborhood, playing in the yard --fetch, tug, & maybe even a dip in the kiddie pool! Gator also loves to snuggle up like a little guy, snoozing the afternoons away with you on the porch. He is an engaging and personable guy, who needs daily interaction (and belly-rubs).

Gator is looking for a home with energetic, active people who are experienced with dogs, even better if with his breed. He is not ideal for living with kids, Gator can play a bit rough and he is a large dog. Also he can be guarded about strangers coming to the house. He may be okay with other dogs, though meet and greet is required and by appointment only. Cats are unknown and not recommended. Gator is a smart fellow, already knowing sit, stay, down, and paw.

If you think your home is the place for Gator then please call or stop down to the HSOC today. We are open 7 days/week 11am-3pm, except major holidays. (609) 398-9500 ext. 1; All of our animals are S/N, UTD and micro-chipped.

NYS Registered Rescue # RR102
NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

These two lovely Pyrs are Samson and Delilah, a truly bonded pair searching for a great home of their own and a family to love them. This adorable couple ended up dumped at an animal sanctuary who reached out to us for help finding them a great home together. They could not be any nicer! They are as gentle as can be and they adore each other. Samson and Delilah are young Pyrs and arrived painfully thin, so thin we have had to wait a couple of months to even be able to spay Delilah. Both dogs love people and get along great with everybody and every creature they meet. They do well with other dogs and cats, and they were gentle with all of the other critters at the sanctuary. They get very sad when they are separated from each other so they are a package deal and will be adopted together. They are currently in boarding waiting patiently for a home or foster home to take them in. These two are absolutely gorgeous dogs and just as sweet. We are not sure what their background was before they arrived to rescue, but these poor dogs were not in good shape. They are now healthy and ready to go to a family who will be very lucky enough to adopt a pair this sweet!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42781384/1/?bust=1537208208', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42781384/2/?bust=1537208220', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42781384/3/?bust=1537208228']",Samson & Delilah - adopted,42781384,M,XL,A

Meet Gluhwein! She is a catahoula leopard dog mix, that is stunning, inside and out. She is extremely people oriented. She loves everyone, and is especially fond of children. She has a sweet personality, and is always wagging her tail. She may look a bit intimidating, but her heart is as big as all outdoors! She has extremely good house manners, and is a true pleasure to have around. Winnie, as she is called, is dog selective. She gets along well with non reactive dogs, after a very slow introduction. She would do best as an only dog. She loves to run and play in our fenced in yard, and would like to have that at her forever home. She has been with us since mid December, and really needs a forever home to call her own. We would invite approved adopters to come and meet this wonderful girl at our home, because the stress of adoption events, masks her true inner beauty. Gluhwein is available thru Wags Rescue.

No kitties please!

Hi, my name is Gluhwein. It's pronounced kinda like glow-ween, but my foster family just call me Winnie! I'm a catahula mix and I'm about 2 years old. I'm a very good dog with tons of energy, and would prefer a fenced in yard! I get along with other dogs, after a slow introduction, but not cats. I love people, and I'm very good with children. I'm good in my crate, but Iâm not in there much. I am house trained and have very good manners. I sleep on my bed at night, (but like to sneak in bed with my foster parents occasionally)! If you would like to meet me, please apply through Wags Rescue, and my foster parents will be happy to set up a private get together, because Iâm really not fond of going to the adoption events. I am a very good dog, and will be a wonderful addition to any family!

Meet Gluhwein. This wonderful girl is about 1 1/2 years old and is absolutely beautiful, inside and out! âWinnieâ, as she is known at her foster home, is a great dog! She has very good house manners, loves people, adores children, and is fine with other dogs after a slow introduction. She is house trained, great in her crate,(but sheâs rarely in a crate), and sleeps soundly at night on her bed. She has a ton of energy, walks well on a leash, and loves to run in our yard, but is always ready to cuddle on the couch and watch a movie. Gluhwein is spayed, fully vetted, up to date on shots, and extremely healthy. She is a special girl that will be a perfect addition to any family. Her foster family welcome private meet and greets at their home, and will be happy to answer any questions about this sweet perfect girl.

Hi, my name is Gluhwein. It's pronounced kinda like glow-ween, but my foster family just call me Winnie! I'm a catahula mix and I'm about 1 1/2 years old. I was a stray that wound up pregnant and in a high kill shelter, where my odds of being adopted in time were very small. Luckily, Wags stepped in and saved me. I was sent to a foster in Pennsylvania where I had nine puppies that are grown enough for me to seek my forever home. I'm a very good dog with tons of energy! I love other dogs and people. I'm very good with children, and are around them daily. I'm good in my crate and am house trained. I sleep on my bed at night and have no issues.

241,Adult,"German Shepherd Dog, Black Mouth Cur","Baron was found wandering the streets and frightened.   He was desperate for food, but ran when approached.....until he found himself caught by animal control and facing death.

When his time was up and room was needed for more animals incoming to the shelter a volunteer reached out to ask us if we'd take him.  He had the sweetest face and eyes that looked soulful.  He was a good boy, but frightened in the shelter.  Once outside that environment he sought his person's approval and attention and looked for direction..

Baron has been brought current on all vaccines, microchipped and neutered.  He's been treated for heart worm and will be on restricted activity........but, that's means leash walking vs letting him run and over exert.  

He's a smaller size weighing in around 40-45lbs and is shy and uncertain until you show him love and attention.  He will make someone a great dog.

242,Adult,Shepherd,"Tina was rescued from NC just before Hurricane Florence hit - she actually made it out just one day before the storm.  She's a sweet, middle aged girl of about 4 or 5 who loves people and wants nothing more than human companionship and attention.  She's medium sized and weighs about 50-55 lbs, is spayed and vaccinated,  housebroken and crate trained.  

Tina's issue is that,  sometime in her past, another dog or dogs weren't so nice to her and she is fearful.  Her defense is showing aggression towards other dogs.  She could successfully be walked on a leash in a park or neighborhood where there are other dogs,  and she walks very well on a leash,  but she will do best not having to closely interact with otter dogs.  She,  therefore,  needs to be an only dog,  and she will make her person or family very happy with the affection she has to offer.  She also loves belly rubs!!

When Jax isnât chewing bones or stealing tomatoes out of his familyâs garden, he spends his days napping on the couch as close to his ownersâ laps as possible. He is an energetic dog whose only goal in life is to make people happy and feel loved. His skills include cuddling, kisses, crate training, basic command obedience, and professional fetching. His family loves Jax dearly and is heartbroken to have to rehome him because of an ongoing feud with his brother, a fellow Pitt. While they use to be best friends who slept side by side, maturity got between them and they now fight. For this reason, Jax now needs to find a home where he is the only pet and can get all the one on one attention and love he deserves.

 

The family is seeking a loving forever home for him with another family who will smother him with kisses. If possible, the family would love to receive photos of Jax in his new life and an update on his life. So, if you are looking to add the most loyal dog to your life to bring joy and energy into your âno other petsâ home, Jax is your good boy!

Fill out an online application here: http://bit.ly/2D6f5Zy
You must be 24 years of age or older to adopt.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING TO THE ADOPTION EVENT:

-all human residents in your household
We require a completed application, reference check, & home check. An adoption fee applies. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. Due to the volume of emails received we are unable to answer specific questions via email. Thank you!

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

270,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Roscoe found himself as a stray at the New York Care Centers back in July 2018.

The volunteers fell for his charm and easy going attitude.  He was scheduled for Euthanasia due to catching the dreaded cold.  A foster stepped up and brought him in as one of her own.

This is what she has to say:

Roscoe is such a joy! You can feel how happy this guy is just by the way he walks.  Roscoe gets along great with other dogs and loves to romp around and play with his foster siblings.  We believe he would do really well in a home with other dogs and/or active fur parents.  He also loves car rides and jumps in on his own as soon as the car door opens. He knows basic commands and always comes when he hears his name.  He is a gentleman on a leash and loves to say hi to anyone passing by and has been around children ages 2 and up. Roscoe is a happy, goofy, friendly, loving, smart boy that gets along great with everyone - he is the complete package!

Perfect home for Roscoe? :  A home where his humans would love to cuddle with him and let him run around.  He is such a happy dog who loves everyone! 

ETC:  Roscoe LOVES to cuddle.  When heâs not chewing on his toys or running around, heâll make himself comfortable right by the closest person.  Something quirky about him is that he makes a funny sound when he plays, unlike any other dog I know!

He has had no issues during his stay with us.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43446792/1/?bust=1543882654', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43446792/2/?bust=1543882659', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43446792/3/?bust=1543882661', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43446792/4/?bust=1543882693', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43446792/5/?bust=1543882695', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43446792/6/?bust=1543882702']",Roscoe,43446792,M,M,A
271,Senior,Poodle,"Please note: We are NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS on Pinky Lee at this time.

Pinky Lee was dumped at a very large, inner city shelter. Reason for being turned in was â could not stand, drinking excessive amounts of water, and urinating excessively.â Needless to say at approximately ten years old, this poor little girl had never been to a vet. She was in need of total grooming and veterinary care.
After several weeks at the shelter, the medical staff diagnosed Pinky Lee with diabetes. She is currently on insulin two times daily. We are working on getting her diabetes under control. She is unable to be spayed at this time due to her diabetes and has mammary gland tumors which could be benign.

At ten pounds and possibly ten years old, Pinky Lee is an adorable little girl. She just wants to be near her human while you watch your favorite tv show, read a book, or take a nap. She loves to be carried like a pampered pup but also loves going for a walk. She adores  going outside and is totally housebroken. Pinky Lee ignores the resident dog and cats in her foster home.

290,Adult,Yellow Labrador Retriever,"This is Noah, and he is a 3-year-old Yellow Lab. Someone saw Noah being dumped in a local grocery parking lot. Since it was raining hard on that day, he was given the name of Noah. Noah had no idea what to do, so he kept trying to get into the store when the doors opened. The manager of the store called animal control, and they picked him up. They then took him back to their facility with his fate uncertain.

As you can see in one of his photos, the facility is a terrible place where dogs live in the dark in paint peeling cells. This is a rural mountain animal control, where IF a dog gets adopted, he could end up living his life on a chain. There is no place for the dogs to run at this facility so all day they just sit and wait, hoping someone will stop by their cell to pet them.

A person who knew a rescuer called and asked her to help Noah. She came to visit Noah, and found him shaking in his cell, partially due to his being shy, and partially due to the cold 38 degree temperatures in this facility. Noah is shy, but also very sweet. He loves to be petted and cuddled, and gets along with other dogs.

Noah is 63 pounds, and has been neutered and fully vetted. All Noah needs now is a home and a family that will love him. Please fill out an application on this great boy today since he will be arriving on January 24th. He would love to have a ""forever"" home waiting for him!

291,Adult,Terrier,"Notes:  
Babar! is such a lovable, huggable fellow with a perky, funny sense of humour. 
Always ""rearin' to go!"" Always game. 
Always enthusiastic & happy!
If he finds you a little down, he notices quickly and rolls himself in a blanket with only his nose and eyes poking out, like a ""pig in a blanket"". 
He is delicious!
When trying to find the right mate to run free with, I was told (by behaviourist) that ""Babar! likes bossy women"".
Babar! is a charming rascal. He sure knows how to wangle his way into your heart. He makes himself irresistible. 
Tolerates small dogs. 
Does not like cats. 
Loves people!
Lived with a parrot at the veterinarian's. 
Blue nose. Silver great. 
Loves to be given a bully stick! He wags his whole body to give the hint. 

Babar began charming us the moment we had the privilege of meeting him at a high kill shelter, where even there he was filled with joy. How could we not rescue him from there and make sure he stayed safe until he could meet...you! ""Happy, happy, happy!!!"" says his foster, when asked to describe the adorable little boy. Babar wags his tail no matter what is happening, and that includes when the vet gives him shots. This is a dog in love with life and all that it holdsâand we mean all. His new best friend is a cat, and he has a great time playing with a neighboring pet parrot.

Initially, Raymond would cower when someone would lift a hand to pet his head. He now knows we are not going to swat him and no longer flinches. Raymond was scared of car rides at first but has decided they are pretty fun and he's not getting left behind anymore. He does well at adoption events and is just a happy boy.

Dog Story:
If youâre reading this, youâre looking for a canine companion and I fit the bill since Iâm a VERY, VERY ACTIVE PUPPY who needs human companionship. Just a short time ago I was caged most of the day. But luckily now Iâm in a foster home with 2 Brittanys to keep me company, a crate and bed of my own, toys and human companionship. The humans talk to me, teach me stuff, tell me NO sometimes (actually lots of times) and tell me Iâm a good girl when I follow the rules. They also provide good food and best of all they cuddle me and give me belly rubs. Life is GOOD!! Since the foster humans already have two Brittanys we hope that one of you will want to adopt me. 

My foster family says I came to them with âNO skillsâ. I have already learned to use the magnetic doggie door! Iâm not great on the leash so I need to practice that. Iâm NOT protective of my food bowl which is good. Iâve learned to play nicely with the resident Britts- 2 femaleâs ages 8 & 7. Iâm learning that toys are for chewing but human hands or shoes are not. My biggest problem is garbage picking, eating paper (I love tissues) and money (Mostly 10'S and 20'S) and counter/table surfing. Iâm learning that NO means I should stop doing what Iâm doing. Iâm learning that I should use the bathroom in the yard and not on a rug. Thereâs still a lot to learn but my foster family says Iâm smart and a fast learner. They say Iâm a youngster and that I turned 1 Year old in September. Iâm very good looking girl with light orange markings and very distinctive eyes. My tail is docked and my foster says they can see the beginnings of feathering on my butt and tail. I'm going to be a really beautiful adult. I like it here but I want a family to call my own, a family that will love me and cherish me and I can love, cherish, protect, and entertain in return. 

Now just a few thoughts from my foster mom and dad who say no and dispenses the foods and belly rubsâ¦As Kalli learns to trust, she is becoming sweeter and sweeter. Sheâs very active as befits her age and breed so she will need regular walks and a fenced in yard where he can run around and explore. She hasnât tried to climb over or dig under the fence (BUT HAS DUG HOLES). She adores playing with my 2 Brittanys , especially my alpha female (but Kalli can get to be too much sometimes) and it is allowing her to be properly socialized as they put her in her place when she gets too rough. She would enjoy all the attention an only dog gets but sheâd benefit from the companionship of another dog. She is jealous when others get attention. She will also benefit from having toys that are for strong chewers. When she gets nippy, weâve been able to distract her with toys. This is a behavior that they outgrow as they mature and have proper training. We have crate trained her and she doesnât seem to mind being crated, but really lets you know when she wants out. She also loves her treats. We are currently working on the sit command and sheâs making quick progress because she loves treats, even the healthy kind like cucumber slices. 

Obviously I (all of us at ABR) hope that our foster dogs find great homes but in this case my hope is really strong. We truly believe we have saved this pup. Sheâs not perfect but she wants to please and is visibly happy when she gets praised. 

You must be considerate enough to know Kalli would not be happy or thrive being crated for 8 hours a day, she does sleep in her crate but that is to keep the house in one piece overnight. The main reason why Kalli wouldnât be happy crated up is because she is very active and loves being around people. So Kalli really needs a home where she will be exercised every day, preferably taken for runs or long fast walks and she needs either a work from home situation or someone who only works away from home part-time. While she loves everyone, if youâve got children they need to be older, 10 yrs. and up, because when she gets excited she jumps and she would hate to hurt a child who canât deal with that. 

Also, having another dog to play with would be the best! Just make sure he/she is tolerant because, according to her foster sisters, she can be a real pest trying to get another dog to play with her. And she also will steal their toys, so he/she has got to be okay with that. Cats are NOT friends Kalli needs a home with NO cats. She also will need a good, strong, secure fence. She wonât jump it but will run up to it and smack it really hard when she sees a bird or squirrel that she wants. Please note she does like to dig so will need someone willing to watch her when she is in the yard. Beyond that she is a very attentive, affectionate, not too sensitive Brittany girl. 

She is spayed, crate trained, healthy and heartworm negative. She knows some basic commands but would benefit from an obedience class. She would be really good at agility so if you like working with dogs Kalliâs got the energy. And smarts for it! Just be sure to use positive reinforcement because Kalli thinks any other correction is playing. We think her former owner used a little strong negative corrections and she would just puppy laugh it off. Everything is play, fetch and run around with Kalli. If you are interested and would like to be considered for Kalli please to fill out the adoption application at www.americanbrittanyrescue.org or http://fs20.formsite.com/brittanyrescue/form10/index.html 

History:  
Kalli was an owner surrender, an older couple contacted ABR, after their family situation changed and realized they could not handle this WHIRLWIND Brittany Puppy.

318,Adult,Chihuahua,"Louie was picked up as a stray and was found to have a mast cell tumor on his rear leg which made it necessary to remove.  However, this has not slowed this tyke down at all and he still likes to go for his walks.  Louie is a typical Chi so we don't recommend he go to a home with young kids.  He can also be bossy with the other dogs and may be best as the only king of the castle.  But he does like to burrow under the blankets and snuggle with his human companions.  

Louie is 6-7 years old and has a big heart in a compact body.  In addition to the surgery on his leg, he also had his vaccines and has been neutered.  Louie will be microchipped prior to adoption.

325,Senior,Chihuahua,"STELLA AND MAX

 COURTESY POST

 CHIHUAHUAS

 When looking for cuddling companions, two Chihuahuas are better than one! Stella and Max are twins, we think. Rescued from a person who kept them outside in the cold, they have bloomed into the loving and beloved duo they once were-happy to meet strangers, willing to snuggle up to men they just met and ready to kiss your nose in exchange for a treat. Stella is a bit blind in one eye but that doesn't slow her down. They race across the room, romping and chasing each other, sometimes ending in a wrestle on the sofa or with Stella standing on her hind legs with her paws dangling at her waist while looking around for her Max, like a prairie dog. 
   They are healthy, up to date with vaccines, and weewee pad trained. They weigh around five pounds- each half s lapfull. 
   In Their ideal home, they'd be the only two dogs. They are senior citizens, hoping they won't have to share the limelight, especially Max. Cats might be ok. I'm not sure. They're a perfect pair for people with time to laugh at their playful antics and to give them the love they missed. (Please, no kids under 13) Please apply to adopt Max and Stella at Rescueridge.com and your application will be forwarded to Little Dog Lifeboat.

I am a sweet girl but am shy and guarded with strangers at first and I can be a little snarky with a typical cocker attitude but once I know you I'm sweet as sugar, loving and affectionate. I was raised as a solo dog and lived a pampered life indoors but I was frustrated and got into things and was a bit destructive. As a result I don't like to be left alone and have a bit of separation anxiety. I am good with other dogs and would love to be with another dog to give me more doggie confidence. I've not met any cats so not sure how I would be living with a cat but I don't think I would mind a cat that likes dogs. Because I can be snarky, it's best if I go with kids ages 10 yrs + but an adult only home would be best!

329,Senior,Chihuahua,"Meet Bailey!  This unusual 9 year old longhair chihuahua came to us when his owners were unable to care for him any longer.  He is extremely overweight, weighing in at 18 pounds, which is about double what he should be!  Heâs a little nervous at first but warms up quickly and is looking for a calmer adult home with someone who will get him on the way to a longer healthier life with a diet and exercise program.  He has some hair loss which we suspect is color dilution alopecia, which is genetically linked to his markings and probably will remain bald but it just makes him extra interesting!  Email njwoof@cs.com if you are interested in meeting him.

We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East, Morris Plains, NJ.

*sweet happy puppy
*had an injury from another dog that left her skull slightly misshapen and with vision loss, but she does very well!
*making good puppy progress on housebreaking
*crates in xpen
*loves people and other dogs
*loves walks!

what Glory's foster mom has to say about baby Glory:
Glory is a great 4 month old pup who loves walks in the woods and loves to play.
She has enough vision right now to retrieve a Frisbee and chase balls.  Glory is doing well in her foster home.  She is healing from her surgery prior to rescue.  She walks well on a leash and is doing great with housebreaking, with an occasional urine accident on a pad in her expen overnight.  
The shelter said she was Chi mix but we do not see it.  We have heard numerous comments about her breed.  I will tell you she is a wonderful mix!    
Glory is a quick learner and loves to give kisses. She is extra cute with her little tongue that sticks out some from her injury.
Her little face is a little distorted from her injury. But all of this is improving with age and healing. Glory has a wonderful personality to have been through so much with her injury.

She is fine walking by dogs in the street, never had an issue with that. She has not been around any young kids only my nieces. I think she will be fine but she is âpawsyâ when requesting pets. She barks when she knows we are home (she is downstairs in the bedroom separate when this happens) and just wants to be with us. When we are not home she doesnât bark. We have a video camera and can hear whatâs going on. She is fine with strangers. She has shown some fear when meeting certain people and I realized that is when they stand over her and stare at her. But once they give her a pet sheâs their friend forever. She was outside when the mailman came and was fine and accepted pets from strangers in fire island. She was initially afraid of my dad, he gave her a treat and now they are best friends and he picks her up to go for rides. I leave her out in the morning and she has free range On the first floor of our house. She has never chewed on anything but her toys and will typically go lay on her bed after I leave.â Star is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped.

Her markings, like her personality, are unique and special. Jenny has cute spots â some look like freckles! And her personality is ever-engaging. She tries to talk to you. She can entertain herself home alone for 8 or 10 hours with her toys and her backyard access, but when you return she is so happy be with you. She loves walks, runs, hikes, playing fetch or tug of war, sitting while watching you cook or clean, watching TV herself (especially anything with a ball) and sleeping next to you when invited. She even likes her crate. From her crate she will watch you attentively and chew on a rawhide or other bone. 

Jenny has a super healthy stomach; she can eat anything. This medium sized, 40 pound young girl is incredibly fit and agile. Her trainer said that she would be great for agility training (a great bonding activity). She has been trained to walk well on a leash but still does best with experienced handlers as she is quite active and strong. We tested her DNA and she is Swiss shepherd (a herding dog), pit and Rottie, although she really doesnât look like any of those breeds. We recommend her as an only pet. But she is very good on a leash walking next to dogs that she likes. 

Jenny is fully housebroken, knows her basic commands, is spayed, up to date on all her shots and ready to be your loyal family pet! Recommended for kids over 12 or active adults. Jenny is a rare gem!

My name is Rosalie. I was saved from death at Liberty Animal Control in GA months and months ago . I was covered in bruises and wounds ALL over my body. I was missing fur and took a while to heal. I have become what is known as the ""tester dog"". I am brought to animal control to interact with other dogs to help them get placed with rescue groups and go on to their new lives. TIme and time again I watch friends of mine that I made here at Carpathia Paws, all leave. I hear about their new forever homes and wonder what that would be like. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful I didn't die in animal control and I am glad I am helping so many others get a chance to leave alive.  I get sad when I have to say goodbye to my friends here at Carpathia . I wish someone would notice me and take me into a real home where I would be part of a family. 
Guess what Rosalie- your plea has been heard!  Thanks to our amazing rescue partners at WAGS. IT'S YOUR TURN NOW ROSALIE!! 

Rosalie was pulled from Liberty Animal Control a few months ago. She was covered in bruises and wounds all over her body that required quite some time to heal. Some spots have not grown back yet. She is a Rednose Pit Mix, about 3 1/2 years old and spayed. She tested positive for HW and will be treated as soon as the medication for treatment comes in. This girl is good with everybody and even grumpy dogs do not mind her! Loves kids, is house and crate trained and walks nice on a leash.

365,Baby,"Rottweiler, Hound","Earl is a 3-1/2 month old mix that weighs 22 pounds. Earl is high energy and needs a lot of exercise. Earl's sister has been diagnosed with a condition called Mega Esophagus. We are closely monitoring the three siblings in hopes that the other 2 do not have it. Earl eats his food soaked in water in 3 smaller meals, but at this point he is unable to drink water from a bowl. He regurgitates it. Therefore, dog parks are a no-no for him. He must eat 3 meals during the day, so he is unable to spend a lot of hours alone. The vet thinks he will out grow this condition because it's very mild, but right now we are using every precaution to ensure he stays healthy. Earl needs a family that is home most of the day, he needs a fenced yard so that he can have the exercise he needs. We are also requiring the adoptive family to purchase doggie insurance on Earl in case of health issues in the future. If your family can handle his special needs, please fill out an application. Joe Joe's Place is not a shelter. We are a network of foster homes, therefore we only allow visits of our animals with an approved application. Please allow up to 72 hours for processing. We do use a first received, first reviewed application process. Due to our requirement of a first visit at the foster home and a follow up home visit at the potential adopters home, we only adopt within 1-1/2 hours of Medford, NJ. Our adoption fee is $300 per dog. That fee covers age appropriate vaccines, microchip and neuter.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39917069/1/?bust=1511159031', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39917069/2/?bust=1511159032', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39917069/3/?bust=1511159032']",Earl,39917069,M,L,A

NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

Didi is our latest ""Cinderella"" transformation. This 3-year-old PB Pyr girl and her pups were surrendered by a farmer who was not pleased that she jumped their little fence and mated with the neighbor's Anatolian Shepherd. Left outside, she was matted, emaciated and had wounds infested with maggots, and even the puppies had maggots attached as well. Didi has been sweet and thankful to be inside and cleaned up, and now she's become a beauty. Now that her pups have been adopted and she's been spayed and back to good health, she's ready for a furever home of her own. After her initial neglect, Didi takes time to warm up to new people, but once she does, she's a sweetie. She is a snuggle-bunny with people, is fine with cats, but can be defensive around other large dogs, so Didi will be placed as an only dog.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41536247/1/?bust=1525297087', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41536247/2/?bust=1525297094', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41536247/3/?bust=1525297103']",Didi in MO,41536247,F,XL,A
368,Young,"Pit Bull Terrier, Dutch Shepherd","*****URGENT******

One of our own pups needs a new home ASAP!

We saved Lucas from the ACC of NYC: At-Risk Animals Urgent list last December.

He was fully trained by our good friends at Allied Dog Training and his new adopter will receive handling lessons and lifetime support from our trainers.

He has been living in harmony with the resident dog for many months until recently.

Lucas received veterinary care today for a bite to his neck and he will be ok.

His adopter has agreed to keep them separate while we frantically search for a foster or adopter.

Lucas is dog friendly but no cats for him.

Lucas is just under 2 years old. He can be fearful with strangers and needs time to trust.

A low traffic home with older kids would be best.

Lucas is super smart- likes to work- did agility while at the Farm.

Adopters should be able to come to the Farm in Southern Dutchess County for handling lessons so his training may be upheld.

Please, please share this boy- we need to find him a foster or adopter ASAP.

Our boy Max is 9 years old, weighs 41lbs and was left in the ACC shelter system when his owner ran out of time to Rehome him.   The owner has a history of absences in and out of max life and was never taken to the vet since he was a Puppy: A few of our members came together to save him. With how emaciated and stiff jointed he was! We thought for sure he was going to be a hospice case.  To all of our surprise Max is a crazy, lively, fun loving dude. He loves a good adventure and is an even better love bug/cuddler NOW that heâs feeling better. 

YES max still has a fatal liver condition BUT his last days are not any time soon! This little lover is living life to his fullest and would love a forever partner to go through life with him. 

Someone please step up to give him the best golden years a dog can ask for!! 

** if you foster OR adopt his monthly medicine expenses will be paid for **

He is on 2 medications indefinitely : Denamarin & Prednisone and Cosequin vitamins which all older adults/seniors should be on for joint and bone support.

We pray someone has a heart for his story the same way he stole everyone at ACCâs heart away and melted us with his dreamy eyes.

375,Young,Greyhound,"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Foster Update 1/20/2015'Rooney was returned for a second time as the home she was in just wasn't a good fit. Rooney is a fun, active, inquisitive, kind of quirky little girl. She at times is very outgoing, yet at other times seems almost shy. Rooney loves to play with toys and has recently learned to 'drop it' as she sometimes does not like to share. She can be a collector of items around the house, so its best to try to keep things you don't want her to get into put away. Rooney is a good eater, crates well, but at times still needs to be watched with her housebreaking. If you are looking for a little snuggle bug, Rooney is your girl.'
_____________________________________________________TB's Rooney is a beautiful, sleek, dainty girl. She has an adorable prance in her step. She's very friendly, gives kisses, chitters and likes to bury her head into you--how cute is she!! She enjoys attention but not in a pushy way. Rooney is 2 years old and cat tolerant with supervision.9/11/2014Rooney was returned after 3 days due to absolutely no fault of her own and she is in a foster home and waiting for her forever home.Foster Update 9/16/2014Rooney is a delightful two-year old girl (DOB 7/20/2012) and is perhaps the tiniest greyhound this experienced Greyhound lover has ever come across. I estimate her to be about 50 something pounds, though she is still gaining some needed weight. She is striking in both her dainty stature and shiny black coat. Her foster home includes three cats. She is curious about them, but is easily redirected from looking at them. We also have two resident greyhounds; she gets along with both and enjoys playing in our fenced-in yard with them. We also have two dog-friendly children, ages 9 and 13; she does well with the children and readily receives gentle pettings from them. Both adults in our home work full time. While we are at work, Rooney is crated. She goes in her crate easily and has had no issues with, or accidents in, the crate. At night, she sleeps on a dog bed next to our bed. She has mastered the stairs and our laminate/tile/wood flooring. She has made excellent progress in house living and manners and has learned that 'pottying' is done outside on walks or in the fenced-in yard. Rooney walks well on a leash and enjoys her jaunts about the neighborhood.Rooney is an affectionate girl who loves the company of people. She has a warm, endearing quality and will make a loving companion to her lucky adopter. 12/23/18 3:04 PM","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30287483/1/?bust=1410906495', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30287483/2/?bust=1480088111', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30287483/3/?bust=1421509586']",Rooney,30287483,F,M,A

Mel is a fun and friendly little girl who enjoys being with people and other calm, non-dominant dogs. She loves a cozy snuggle including a good ear rub of her long beagle ears. She is a cuddler for sure, so if you're not, she's not the girl for you!

Mel has been great with other dogs, cats, kittens, and older children. She is fine with younger children, but just might be a bit overwhelmed with active crying toddlers, so older children would be best. She is crate trained overnight and when left for short periods of time and is doing great with her house-training.  She will need experienced adopters willing to work on housetraining, and who have a schedule in which they can do so.  Mel MUST have a fenced in yard in her forever home (preferably with a concrete slab that is OK to void on!), as well as another young beagle to keep her company. She will make a fabulous addition to the right family...could it be yours?

Kayla was not producing milk with enough nutrition to keep her babies thriving and as a result she was separated from her surviving baby.  (But donât be sad she has been reunited with her and knows she is thriving and doing well!)  Kayla is a senior girl that is probably in double digit years.  She would like nothing more than to live out her golden years on someoneâs couch and be a loyal companion.  Kayla is lazy and enjoys her naps.  She is not a fan of going for long walks and would rather relieve herself in the fenced-in yard and then go back inside.  When you first meet Kayla she is hard to read â she has a serious poker face!  But if you give her some time to settle in you will fall in love with her squishy face and low maintenance needs.  Kayla is housetrained but given her senior age she does have accidents occasionally.  She would do best in a low energy house that doesnât have stairs. Kayla is spayed and up to date her vaccinations.  Kayla is dog friendly but not good with cats.  Kayla is prone to watery eyes and ear infections due to her breed.  Her adopter will have to comfortable with cleaning her face.

Some dogs just pull at your heartstrings. Some dogs teach us what inner strength and courage are all about. Some dogs just want to play and stay in the moment, one sniff of fresh air, one listening to the sounds of people laughing, birds chirping, wind blowing. Martin just wants to enjoy his life. Saved by Rescue Ridge from a local, overcrowded, inner city shelter, Martin awaits your love and his forever home in a foster home. He loves people! Martin is very smart and alert. He enjoys
company
. He is dog-friendly with dogs who understand that, because he is visually impaired, he doesn't always understand social cues and is a bit clumsy. Martin is best in a home with older children because he probably can only see shadows. This impairment doesn't stop him from enjoying running around the play yard at his foster home or snuggling on the couch by your side. He is affectionate and very sweet. If you put a treat in front of his face, he will try his best to take it gently but does not always succeed. He can't help it. He tries. Martin is housebroken. He needs a fenced in yard and needs supervision in the yard because he will follow a scent and can escape. He is a wonderful boy, around 5 yrs. old.
Will
you take him home and show him that his life matters? Please apply to adopt Martin in central N. J. at Rescue Ridge at rescueridge.com and text 732 546 8805 to meet him. Here is Martin's video debut

We are certain that with some time and patience, Diesel will forget his past and move on to a brighter life.

Hi!  Thanks for stopping by.  My name is Diesel and I am going to tell you a bit about myself.  I was found in rural WV, stashed away in an outside cage with very little interaction with people.  My owner didn't want me or my 3 brothers and sister Lucy anymore because we wouldn't hunt.  So sadly, we were discarded away as if we didn't matter.  Well, some kind ladies caught wind of what was going on and they sprung into action.  They pulled all of us out of our dirty, cold and meager existence and brought us to a vet office to be examined and cared for.  A Beagle rescue in PA is taking 3 of our brothers and All Mutts Matter (AMMF) is taking in me and Lucy.  A HUGE Thanks to BREW for taking in our 3 brothers.  We know they will get the rehabilitation and love needed so that they can be adopted to loving homes.   Once Lucy and I get to AMMF, we too will go into foster homes where we will continue learn some more house manners and get prepared to start a new life with a kind family.  I am approximately 3 years old, neutered, up-to-date on shots, wormed, on flea/tick and heartworm preventatives, shy and learning to live in a house.  I am crate trained and working on my potty training.  Me and Lucy will be coming north very soon.  If you would like to have me join your family, please go to www.allmuttsmatter.org and fill out an adoption application.   Thanks so much for reading about me and I hope to hear from you soon. Luv, Diesel.

Our adoption process is below:

1. The application will be processed, evaluated and we will contact the vet and personal references;
2.  All other applications that have been submitted on Diesel will also be processed (best suited applicant is chosen, not first come first serve);
3. Schedule a home visit; and
4. Adoption finalized when the best-fitting home is found.  Our adoption fee for Diesel is $295.00.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34587550/1/?bust=1457624699', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34587550/2/?bust=1457624700']",Diesel,34587550,M,S,A

When to Come:
Unless noted differently above, our hours are Monday-Saturday 10am-4pm and Sunday 1pm-4pm. Our adoptions are first come, first served based on the status of your application. 

What to Bring:
Please bring a copy of your current pet(s)â vaccination records (if you currently have a dog or cat or did within the last 2 years) and a copy of your lease (if you rent or own a condo/co-op/townhouse) in case we are unable to get hold of your veterinarian or landlord/management company on the day you come in.

We do same day adoptions pending application approval/satisfactory reference checks, except in the case of dogs listed as Trainer Adoptions (on occasion, some Trainer Adoption dogs are able to go home same day). With all adoptions, every person living in the home where the dog will reside must come meet the dog, and any dogs already in the home must come for a meet and greet as well.

We do NOT hold animals, nor do we accept deposits in advance. If you have discussed coming in to meet an animal or have an approved application, this does not guarantee that you will get a particular puppy or dog. If you do not bring your dog(s) or all residents of your home to meet the dog, we cannot hold that dog for you.

All dogs and puppies are spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated (age appropriate), and come with a free veterinary visit from a participating vet within seven days of adoption.

408,Baby,"Newfoundland Dog, Border Collie","Tucker is an absolutely stunning, large, 7 month old Newfie/Border Collie mix. This fluffy and soft guy is always full of happiness, romping around with his adorable, white tipped tail high in the air. He enjoys playing with the other dogs in his foster home and his many toys and especially likes trying to take branches and sticks into the house to add to his toy collection. He loves to toss his toys around, pouncing on, and rolling around with them.

Truly a joy to watch, Tucker flits from one fun activity to the next, enjoying every moment! True to his possible Newfie heritage, this guy does believe it is his duty to wipe his wet face on you, and itâs hard to be upset when he looks at you with those darling eyes and asks to be pet. Tucker is house and crate trained, walks well on a leash, and sleeps through the night. This guy would love to bring his positive energy to the lucky home that adopts him!

As sweet as he is, Tucker is a big, eager puppy and does not realize his size or strength, so he is not suitable for a home with young children or very small animals.  He needs a home with a fenced yard and another young dog to play with.  Please note: Tucker also has been diagnosed with hip displaysia in both of his rear legs; he would do best in a home that has experience with this in large breed dogs.


Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

She is sweet little girl who loves to be cuddled, take lap naps or curl up on the couch to watch a movie with you. She can be a little shy at times and would not do well in a home with small children.

Tiny Cupcake was surrendered to the shelter in horrible condition. Her teeth had been terribly neglected, she had a nasty cold and her skin was flaky and itchy from poor nutrition. She seemed so scared and depressed at the city shelters, she wouldnât even lift her head.

Thankfully, after just a few day in her foster home, she has come out of her shell tremendously and is feeling so better. She is a quiet but curious girl and likes to explore the house on her own. She is being fostered with other dogs of various sizes and gets along well with them all. Cupcake is deaf and she relies on other dogs to guide and comfort her, therefore Cupcake MUST go to a home with one or more low energy, friendly dogs.

Hi! I'm Chloe! How did a cutie like me end up in rescue you ask? Well, my first human family did not think puppies needed supervision, or training so they surrendered me... but that's okay because TLR promised to find my FUREVER family!! Clearly I am cute as a button, 4 to 5 months old and about 30 pounds right now. I am a typical lab puppy with endless energy. I love adventures, water, toys, car rides, other dogs and all sorts of things! I'm just a happy go lucky kinda gal! I am super smart and love learning. I am crate trained, and am working super hard at house training. I know sit and I take treats super gentle. I think I would love kids too (under supervision of course!) Just remember I am still a puppy and I will need my family to teach me everything I need to know about growing up to be an awesome dog! I am so looking forward to having my very own family to take me on awesome adventures and to give them endless love... will you fill out an application for me today??

425,Young,Great Pyrenees,"When Julius, Octavius, and their mom Ophelia were abandoned by their owners, that may have been the best thing that ever happened to them. A concerned citizen picked up the little family and took them to the shelter in Lockhart, TX, where they were bathed, dewormed, and vaccinated. Their photos were posted on Facebook and volunteers stepped up to rescue, transport, and foster them.

We are guessing that the little family are Pyrenees mixes. At 10 weeks old (as of 8/4), Octavius weighs 19 lbs, and Julius weighs almost 17 lbs, so itâs reasonable to estimate their adult weight at something between 70 and 90 lbs. The whole family is enjoying life in Texas while they wait for their forever families to apply to adopt.

Mom Ophelia is about a year old & weighs 61 pounds. S
he is very sweet and affectionate -- she loves to cuddle on the sofa with her human. Since w
e can only imagine the horrors of her past, she is what we would deem a ""flight risk"" and must always be on leash, even in a fenced in yard as she can, will, and has jumped a 6 foot fence.

Ophelia does fine with the barn cats at her foster home, the friendliest of whom rubs up against Opheliaâs legs every time sheâs in the barn. We feel that cats shouldnât be a problem for her.

Playing with other young dogs is a big part of Opheliaâs life here. She doesnât discriminate based on size or gender â she will play with pretty much anyone, and she is usually the one who starts it.
Ophelia is fine left home alone with other dogs, as long as itâs not for too long. She would not be a good fit for someone who works outside the home for a normal 8-hour workday at this point, but we hope that as she matures she will be less likely to become bored & entertain herself in ways she shouldn't. :)

Ophelia has been spayed and microchipped, so she, too, is ready to start a new life.

Scully will do best in a home with a yard, active or homebody family but one that is either willing to continue her training or understands that unless you know what you're doing.  If you're looking to ADOPT and fit this criteria then please consider Skully.  This sweet and loving redhead is an amazing family dog but she must be an only dog.  No cats, no other dogs. Her training has certainly improved her reactiveness towards other animal but the trigger is still there.  Aside from that she is perfect.

He does not enjoy the company of other dogs so he should be the only dog in the household. In his foster home he has been the perfect gentleman...no accidents in the house and great in the car and on the leash. He is nervous when he first meets new people so he would need a home where someone would understand this and be patient with him. He should not be in a home with young children because of this quirk. Once he trusts you he is your best bud. He is an easy dog in the home and is happy to sleep at the side of your bed or just play with his toys. He takes treats very gently and does not require a ton of attention. This guy really deserves a home of his very own with an experienced ""dog mom or dad"".

I recently joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center's lifesaving facility and I am hoping you will stop by soon to meet me in person!  I am the package deal - I am up to date on my vaccines, I am neutered, and micro-chipped!  I got the chance to take a nice, long walk with one of the wonderful volunteers here and let me tell you, it was heaven!  I strolled along pleasantly and enjoyed the one on one time out of my kennel!  I didn't want to go back in!  I'm hoping my perfect family comes by soon and takes me away from kennel life forever!  The people here really are wonderful, but spending time with them just makes me more excited about the prospect of finding my own people!  Maybe, juuuust maybe that's you!  I sure do hope so! While I wait for the perfect people, I am spending time in foster care - to learn more about me and to arrange a visit, please contact the foster coordinator at foster@providenceac.org  I really don't take up too much space at only about 13 pounds, so all you need is a teensy bit of extra space in your home and some extra love to give!  I'll be waiting here for you to come scoop me up!  Love, Max""

430,Adult,Akita,"This big guy (115 pounds) loves to play! Mel was left at a NJ shelter after his owner was moving. Mel will need a breed experienced owner, one that also has the physical strength to handle a big bouncy juvenile male. Mel knows some basic commands and is food motivated. Mel has been fully vetted and would do best in a large securely fenced in back yard where he can get plenty of exercise. While living at BEAR, Mel has made friends with two of our females! He is playful with both females however he will not tolerate a male dog in his space. It is best that he not be placed with small animals or small children, as he is big and bouncy and could knock over a small child or an older person. This is a big strong boy who clearly has no idea of his size and strength. 

Do you think you have what it takes to give this big happy guy a safe home? Please go to www.bigeastakitarescue.org and fill out an online adoption application for Mel-Man!

435,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Background: Donna was brought to ACCT Philly in desperate need of care â thought to have possibly been hit by a car and unable to walk, good Samaritans found her and brought her in.  Unfortunately she was determined to have a pyometra, or infection of the uterus, and needed an immediate spay and medical attention provided by the veterinary team.  Over a week after her ordeal and Donna still wasnât standing out to adopters. Luckily we saw something in her worth giving her a chance and we were quickly rewarded with her sweet nature and willingness to play with everyone! 

Update: Donna is a real beauty inside and out! She has a soft glossy coat, deep eyes, and really just wants to spend time with her favorite people.  She is very calm and collected - as long as she gets some affection she is quite happy to cuddle on the couch or go for a walk. Donna is doing very well in training and has already begun to master her basic obedience - she will make an incredible family pet!

She is very calm and collected - as long as she gets some affection she is quite happy to cuddle on the couch or go for a walk.  She rides nicely in a car.  While in the New Leash on Life program in the Philadelphia prison, she mastered her basic obedience cues (sit, down, come, leave it, kennel up) along with a few cute tricks.  And she gets along with other dogs.  Donna is the perfect gal for a person with a laid back lifestyle.  Sheâs currently living in foster care and would love to meet you!

You get Daphne, the most darling, adorable, near-perfect dog you could ever imagine having. This 8-year young, 15-pound bundle of love excels in virtually every department.

This girl is full of cuddles, snuggles, hugs and kisses. Her only real desire to is make her human(s) happy. And in return, all sheâll want from you is your love, your loyalty, and a never-ending supply of liver snaps!

439,Adult,Pug,"Hi potential family...I specialize in stealing hearts...can I try YOURS? Ruff House Rescue ""Goes Big"" so more pets have a chance to go home. This means we are rescuing in areas that we can make the biggest lifesaving impact. While we continue to help our local dogs and families in NY wanting to surrender their pets we are compelled to help the animals most in need from the highest kill rate shelters in the country and the highest statistic for strays. Hundreds and thousands of highly adoptable puppies and dogs are killed daily. Therefore the majority of our pets come from these areas. This means the cost of rescue is higher due to the high costs of vetting, boarding, and transport. Please note our adoption fees vary and are the most reliable source of revenue enabling us to continue our rescue efforts. Your adoption fees directly contribute to the rescue of these animals. Please see our website for information and an application to adopt or foster or volunteer for RHR. Adoption fees vary from $250 to $500 which includes a pets spay/neuter - Micro-chipping - current vaccinations - heartworm testing. We ask that adopters submit applications in advance to help facilitate the adoption process. Please note while you may not be sure what pet you are interested in if any your application will help us find you the perfect match. Applications at Ruffhouserescue.org - *Please only submit an application if you are available immediately to adopt. Have a rental agreement to have a pet and all family members are ready to adopt.

441,Senior,Pit Bull Terrier,"Meet Mae! (formerly Mea at Brandywine Valley SPCA)

Mae was dumped at 10 years old.... she had owners who attempted to surrender her at a shelter and when they were refused, they let her go near the shelter and refused to call the shelter back when they found her. We aren't sure why because she is absolutely amazing! We will let her tell you for herself.....

""Hi, everyone! My name is Mae! Not to brag or anything, but I have to be one of the most beloved dogs ever!! And knowing this, I really believe that one day my FOREVER family is going to walk through the door and bring me home with them!???

I am potty-trained and wait patiently wait for someone to take me outside. I will gently howl by the door to let you know that I have to go - I'm told it's super cute! I also love being with people, so sometimes they have to convince me to go in my crate when it's time for them to leave the house; but, I always go! What can I say? I want to spend all of my time being pet with my people! I am great with children and live with 2 in foster care, great on the leash, and know all of my basic commands, such as sit, lay down, and give paw.
 
While I'm treat-motivated (great for training), I never beg for food. I also always love to meet new people and I like to relax in my bed when nobody is available to snuggle. And listen, I also learned that I donât really love the stairs anymore... my hips arenât what they used to be, okay? I also will do best in a home environment with other calm dogs who understand that I can be somewhat hypersensitive to movement since I have some blind spots in my vision and donât want to play rough with my old lady hips! And lastly, I donât like cats... but who does?

I paw-mise that I am very sweet, and loyal, and lovable; and I want a family of my own now. So, what do you say? Are you going to give me a shot?â

Mae is spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, 4dx heartworm negative, on monthly prevention, microchipped, and dewormed. She will have senior panel bloodwork and urinalysis run prior to adoption and will be on allergy injections and Dasuquin for her age-related arthritis.

Mae is a 52 lbs cutie patootie elderbull looking for a new home that will not give up on her this time around! If that is you, visit our website for an application: www.bellareedpbr.com/adoption

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. 

Our dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! 

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)

Our dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  
Please, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!

Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

447,Adult,Plott Hound,"When people talk about dogs.. wishing they could be more like a dog.. Poe is what we refer to.. he's had some rotten luck in life.. but he is such a happy, fully present, utterly content wounded wanderer! Po sustained an injury and now his hind legs move as one limb with two paws!  ITS AMAZING actually how well he moves along.. PLUS.. he's got an incredible attitude! Happy.. Poe is a happy happy sweet humble boy who's only got space for happy!

Poe thoroughly enjoys group plays with other get-along kinda dogs.. a challenging male dog will prove to be a bit threatening to Poe so we make sure to pair him up with wiggly, easy going, confident doggies. Pippy, Penny, Madeline, Leo to name a few of his buddies! As stated above, despite his previous injury, Poe sure does well sprinting around the yard with his buds. Once in a while, he might trip but he always gets right back up and continues play. Now.. Poe's most FAV game ever is FETCH.. he will chase a ball all day long! He even knows how to drop the ball on command (often in trade for a treat!!) so we can give it another throw. He'll often break away from the pack to join up in a nice ball game.  

Guaranteed you'll never meet another dog like Poe in your life. We're not quite sure how Poe became the way that he is but we are sure he doesn't skip a beat! Did we mention he loves to SWIM?!

The Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

Meet Apollo!!!!  Apollo was pulled from a local shelter.  He was abandoned in a car lot with a bunch of other dogs.  Apollo has been in daily training for the past 6 months, and is doing great. Apollo knows sit, stay, lie down, fetch, and paw. He is a big, strong, and athletic boy who just wants to please and needs lots of exercise!  Apollo is a teddy bear who is great with strangers and friendly to people he meets.  Apollo walks in a heel on leash and does not pull. However, Apollo does NOT like other dogs and while he does not lunge or pull toward other dogs, he does need to keep a clear distance. Apollo would do best with a fenced in yard, but he will stay on your property if supervised off-leash. Apollo does not like thunderstorms or fireworks, but is fine if provided a quiet and safe space. Want to hit the beach? Apollo LOVES the water and will play fetch and swim. Apollo loves rides in the car, and is a good passenger, laying down in the back seat. Apollo is a gentleman when playing or taking treats, he is obedient, loyal, and very affectionate. If you are looking for a BFF to go everywhere with you, and be your companion on your adventures, please consider Apollo. He is the dog you will remember for a lifetime!  Prior GSD experience is highly recommended for this awesome dog.

GSGSR primary service area is New Jersey, Eastern PA, Delaware Valley and Manhattan.  We are not able to service Long Island at this time.  

The age requirement for adoption is 25 to 70 years old; If you are outside of this age range, please email us first.

We require all adopters attend professional training with their adopted dog.  Exceptions are made for adopters who are K-9 professionals or for senior dogs being adopted.

We are an all volunteer organization and every effort is made to proceed as efficiently as possible with an application. As with all rescues, we do require veterinary references if you have a pet, personal reference, a phone interview and home visit. This process has been created to insure that we match each applicant with the best possible dog.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/1/?bust=1534042833', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/2/?bust=1534042834', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/3/?bust=1534042835', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/4/?bust=1520145033', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/5/?bust=1534042835', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/6/?bust=1520145232']",Apollo,41098518,M,L,A

If you are interested in a specific animal, please email info@evessanctuary.com with the name of the animal you are interested in written on the subject line. Please remember that ESAR requires a full complete application, an interview, and a home visit prior to final approval and placement of adopted animals. It may seem daunting at first, but to find true love its worth it, right? They aren't products on a shelf to buy, we love them like our own, and only want the best possible home for each and every one...thus the ""hoops."" Also, please trust our recommendations, we are skilled human furry freind matchmakers with many years of experience that has given us a unique and solid perspective. For these reasons we prefer adopters to be in NYC or the immediate area accessible by public transportation so we can work with you individually and educate you face to face!
Additionally, please understand that we are all volunteers, no salaries are paid, we have families and pets of our own, and we have full time jobs in addition to doing rescue work - so we may be (at times) slow-ish to get back to you. We promise we are doing our best as its in everyones best interest to place these darlings quickly, so we can save more. If you would like to expedite the process, and make us extra happy, please download our application from our website at: http://www.evessanctuary.org/Adoption.html , fill it out, and return it with your initial email inquiry.

Fill out an online application here: http://bit.ly/2D6f5Zy
You must be 24 years of age or older to adopt.
**If this dog is listed here that means s/he is STILL available**

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING TO THE ADOPTION EVENT:
-a printed copy of your completed online application
-all human residents in your household
We require a completed application, reference check, & home check. An adoption fee applies. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. Due to the volume of emails received we are unable to answer specific questions via email. Thank you!

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

A week ago I was sleeping on cold concrete in a shelter. I didn't understand stairs or the front door and I was scared of overpasses when I arrived. I got over that quickly. I learned how to run next to a bike in the park. I even learned that I am supposed to go to the bathroom outside in the cold rather than the nice warm comfort of inside (weird, but I learned quickly and now never get it wrong). I am super soft and affectionate and I love saying hi to everyone on the street. And they love me. I am gentle and I like kids and all dogs and am just thrilled to be alive. I am 10 months old and have all the silly adorable enthusiasm of a puppy without the bad habits. I'm told I will make a perfect dog, especially for someone who enjoys equally going for runs, hikes or bike rides as much as hanging at home stroking my soft silky fur. Come and meet me and you will fall in love with me. Goose is a 10-month-old hound and anatolian shepherd mix who is likely to be 60lbs fully grown. She is up to date on all age appropriate medical care and microchipped. This dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

Good with other dogs and would do well with a dog buddy in his new home. Not recommended for cats because he likes to chase them. Loves kids and recommended for children 10 years and older due to his size and active nature. Luke is very active outside, but settles down quickly in the house. Quiet and well-mannered inside, housebroken and crate trained. Obeys basic commands.  Loves to be with his people.  Good on a leash, rides great in the car.  When he first came to us, Luke had heartworms, but he was treated without complications and cured and is now ready for adoption.

471,Young,Chihuahua,"Update 1/16: Out shy Hillary is still hoping to find her very special forever home although she has made herself very comfy in her foster home in the meantime.  She sleeps cuddled in bed right next to her foster mom every night, and Ioves to play and wrestle with her doggie friends.  She is looking for a very special adult multi-dog home that will give her her space and time to adjust, and understand that she will always have her fears.  Hillary is a ~4 year old chihuahua mix rescued from a hoarding situation with 19 other chis who all lived in a pen outside with little human contact.  Hillary was the most terrified of the group and had obviously never been touched at all.  She has gone through the ASPCA's behavioral rehabilitation program to help work with her fearfulness and has come a LONG way in learning to bond to people.  She is still very skittish of strangers and loud noises, but starting to get playful and enjoy being petted by the few she has bonded to.  She LOVES other dogs and follows their lead, so she will be looking for a home with at least one friendlier dog to help her come out of her shell, and a very special person willing to give her time to be comfortable.  Please email us if you are interested in setting up an appointment to meet this special little girl...We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East next to 5 Star Car Wash (formerly Boulder Car Wash) in Morris Plains (Denville on GPS).  To help us better match a pet to your household, we request you fill out an application on our homepage www.secondchance.petfinder.com and copy and paste it into an email, or print it and bring it to our adoption day when you come.   Local inquiries only please- we do not do long distance adoptions.

Mutley has come leaps and bounds since coming to our rescue. He loves his foster family but is still a little shy around newcomers. Mutley would be good for a home without small kids. He is crate trained and housebroken. He is getting used to being in a home as he was found running the streets alone and not being loved. He is sweet once he gets to know you, it will take time and patience. He is great for walking on a leash; no tripping hazard. Loves any kind of food  He would love a home of his own so he can be spoiled like he deserves.
Mutley is very smart and loves to play. He would probably do well with agility training if you are into that.


We believe he is about 4 years or perhaps younger. He is neutered and UTD on shots. 
Mutley deserves love and to be treasured for the rest of his life.

Ruff House Rescue ""Goes Big"" so more pets have a chance to go home. This means we are rescuing in areas that we can make the biggest lifesaving impact. While we continue to help our local dogs and families in NY wanting to surrender their pets we are compelled to help the animals most in need from the highest kill rate shelters in the country and the highest statistic for strays. Hundreds and thousands of highly adoptable puppies and dogs are killed daily. Therefore the majority of our pets come from these areas. This means the cost of rescue is higher due to the high costs of vetting, boarding, and transport. Please note our adoption fees vary and are the most reliable source of revenue enabling us to continue our rescue efforts. Your adoption fees directly contribute to the rescue of these animals. Please see our website for information and an application to adopt or foster or volunteer for RHR. Adoption fees vary from $250 to $500 which includes a pets spay/neuter - Micro-chipping - current vaccinations - heartworm testing. We ask that adopters submit applications in advance to help facilitate the adoption process. Please note while you may not be sure what pet you are interested in if any your application will help us find you the perfect match.

Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (http://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (http://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

492,Young,"Pit Bull Terrier, Boston Terrier","Update: 1/16: Our special shy Gummy is still waiting her the right understanding forever home.  She loves playing with her doggie friends in her foster home and is looking for a calmer adult home with at least one other dog.  She's about 3 years old now although she has a forever puppy face:).  10/19/14:  Gummy has come a long way in learning to trust and make new friends and is graduating from the ASPCA's behavior rehabilitation center.   She is a cute funny girl looking for a calmer adult home that will continue her socialization and another doggie friend to play with.  5/8/14:  Gummy is going through a behavior rehabilitation program to help her learn to trust more people and hopefully acclimate more easily to a home... she is a sweetheart who is cute and playful once she bonds but has remained very nervous of strange people and situations.  Stay tuned for updates... she will hopefully be ready for adoption in 6-8 weeks and will be looking for a calmer adult home with another friendly doggie playmate for her to help her feel more comfortable. Gummy Bear and 8 of her siblings (all staffy/chihuahua! mixes believe it or not!) were living in filthy conditions in a yard in Yonkers and being given away for free on Craig's List when luckily the local shelter stepped in and took them all. She is only 14 months old and was never socialized outside her yard- she is the most terrified of the group and was clinging to the back of her cage in the shelter when we met her, so we knew we had to help her!   She will need a special calmer home that will be patient in socializing her and teaching her to trust- she is already warming up and wagging her tail at her foster mom.  She is only about 25lbs full grown and looks just like a shrunken pit bull:)  Please submit an application if you can give her the safe loving home she deserves to make up for a rough start in life....We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East next to 5 Star Car Wash (formerly Boulder Car Wash) in Morris Plains (Denville on GPS).

My foster mom went on vacation and left me with some other humans who have a small dog who doesnât get along with anybody. They were impressed as I won her over and had her playing in no time! My mom says I am content to be alone as I love to just play and play with toys, with or without those boys! It is pretty special when my people love on me and I LOVE to give lovens' back! I really think I would make a great lap dog despite what my people say about my size...as you see, I am already getting quite large for my age :) I like riding in cars and I will go to the door to let you know I need to go potty.

504,Adult,"Pug, Chihuahua","Introducing Razzle Dazzle!, Her close friends call her Razz :)  Razz was surrendered to a local shelter with a few mammary cysts, double hernias and was not spayed.  On top of that she came down with kennel cough then pneumonia before she was pulled into PLDP Rescue. Also along with her obvious ailments she has a heart murmur and some rotted teeth were discovered.   She sure had a long road ahead of her.  It took a couple months to get her well enough to under go surgery.  Razz did fantastic during surgery and was a long recovery, but she is finally available for adoption! Razz would do best in an adult only house because she can be a little mouthy whether its just playing, getting overly excited, or can be a tad bratty sometimes.  She really is such a happy-go-lucky girl!  She just needs that special home that is going to love and spoil her forever.  Razz also has luxating patellas so minimum stairs is most ideal, and pain medication or joint suppliment maybe needed. We were able to get her totally off the pain medications as of now and is doing well.   Razz doesn't like crates so a gate in the kitchen or spare room would be best for her when home alone for too long, or foster mom uses a pack & play and she doesn't escape.   She isn't house broken but taking her outside every hour or so she does do well.   Razz's biopsy did come back as precancerous. Razz can live with over mello dogs and cats.  Razz is a laid back girl and enjoys chewing bully sticks to pass the time.   Foster mom knows Razz is a special girl and is hoping that the right family sees her picture and happy video and will open their home and their heart to her.

NOTE: Deja's adoption fee is FULLY SPONSORED by friends of Bella-Reed!

""Hi, my name is Deja and I am around 7-8 yrs. old. I am looking for a forever home where I can be the one and only pet to live out my Golden Years! I was found as a stray by the Brandywine Valley SPCA where I quickly became theÂ shelter favorite. Everyone tells me I have a great disposition, and even though I'm not quite sure what that means, I do LOVE everyone. I also love to play, and I can still jump higher than any of those youngsters to catch a ball or one of my favorite toys.Â 

Bella-Reed was made aware of me when their branch Saving Elderbulls reached out to the shelter to see if they had any elderbulls to feature on their page. Our president fell in love with my face and found me a foster spot.

At my age it is nice to have a soft place to lay my head and a blanket to cuddle underneath. I have not done well with allÂ dogs andÂ I am a little too interested in cats, so a home without other pets would be best (see below). I love humans of all ages -Â I promise to keep any kidsÂ busy playing catch!Â I am move-in ready, I know my manners, and I know to always to potty outside. I don't mind saying it but I think I'm practically perfect in every way. So won't you please think about adding me to your family?Â 

Love, Deja""

***Â Deja does not do well with female dogs. She did, however, meet a low-key male while in foster and after her initial excitement she was fine around him. She does not react to dogs during walks.

Deja is fully vettedÂ including spay, microchip, vaccines, deworm, 4dx heartworm test (negative), monthly heartworm prevention, senior bloodwork, and urinalysis. She has a clean bill of health!

Whether you want someone to watch tv with or a friend to take a long stroll with, Leon is your guy. He's super quiet and loves to explore and sniff outside. His favorite activity is napping in the coziest corner of your couch or tucked away in his crate. In the warmer seasons, Leon would be the perfect buddy to sit on a park bench and people-watch for hours with. Leon is an 8-year-old poodle mix who is fully grown at 15lbs. He is up to date on all age appropriate medical care and microchipped. This dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you're interested in adopting, the first thing you should do is fill out an adoption application at www.muddypawsrescue.org. We will be in touch with you within 7 days of receiving your application!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43540999/1/?bust=1545152736', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43540999/2/?bust=1545152740', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43540999/3/?bust=1545152754']",Leon,43540999,M,M,A
513,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Brains, brawn and a penchant for squeaky toys; all three of these make up the handsome Dozer. Like his name implies, Dozer has a way of ""bulldozing"" his way into your heart. He is an active and playful dog that has face wrinkles that could go on for days. Dozer loves the outdoors and would play in the yard for hours if we let him. Whether you have a toy or not, he is by your side, enjoying the fresh air!Â 

Dozer came to our shelter by unusual means: he was found in a local neighborhood by a Good Samaritan, and had no collar or other identification. Since the neighborhood was right next to the highway, we presumed that Dozer had been left by someone and luckily was found right away. The odd circumstances of Dozer's arrival have done nothing to detract from the warm, spirited dog that we have gotten to know. He is clearly a dog that has had his fair share of both good and bad luck, and we know that he can only have better luck from now on.

Being so handsome has its privileges, and one of them is that Dozer would love to be your one and only pet. We are seeing more and more of his personality and potential with other dogs, but he would love the limelight all to himself. Since Dozer is so versatile in his interests, he could easily fit in with any lifestyle. A family that loves to hike? He's got granola bars and wool socks already. A single person that likes to stay in and watch movies? If you don't mind popping a bowl of popcorn for Dozer, he'll be by your side. He is a truly special dog and we would love to see him find his family!

514,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Black Mouth Cur","14 Dec 2018: Meet 80lbs of sweetness. While Champ is a big boy, he is a sweet, gentle dog. He happily greets each morning with a wagging tail and big smile. Champ walks nicely on leash, and he ignores barking or excitable dogs on his walks. He does have a fair amount of energy and requires a minimum brisk daily walk of 2 miles to drain his excess energy. Having a fenced in yard would be a bonus, especially since Champ loves playing in the snow. Champ is crate trained and easily goes in his crate. He is house trained and travels well in the car. Champ gets along with cats and dogs. Champ has not been around small children -- but given his size he might accidentally knock over a small child.

Champ loves nothing more than to be with his people. Heâs a velcro dog, who follows you all around the house. When you sit, he sits next to you and loves nothing more than to get his belly rubbed. Champ takes treats gently from you. Overall, Champ is a good, sweet dog, who was dealt a bad hand. Champ was adopted as a puppy but unfortunately due to his family's change in living situation and a baby on the way, this sweet guy finds himself in need of a new home again. He is currently in a foster home and doing well.

NO INQUIRIES WITHOUT APPLICATION (Link Below) 
- PLEASE READ ENTIRE AD 

Yuki is such a sweet little guy but the vet says he may have been abused and as a result may have some slight brain damage. He certainly has his quirks. 
Yuki is probably a Maltese/yorkie mix, about 4 yrs old and weighs 10lbs. 
Yuki will need lots of work on settling in into new situations.  He seems to be afraid of bowls and will only eat his food from the floor. He spins when he is excited and walks in circles when he is stressed. Yuki has his own language and gets frustrated when you don;t understand it. He LOVES to go for walks and walks really well on the leash. He would do best with a family that doesn't mind doing a work on gaining his trust. Yuki needs a quiet home where someone is home most of the time as he has some separation anxiety. 


Please, no children, Yuki needs a quiet home with people to love him for the rest of his life. 

Yuki would love to be someone's little buddy.

Yuki is neutered, microchipped and current on shots.

Sky - COURTESY POST 

Hi! My name is Sky. It was Smiley when I was at Animal Control in Philly. You can see why I had that name in my pictures. I'm one year old, about 44lb and not that tall. That is quite an improvement from when I was found weighing only 31lbs! See, I was found as a stray and had already had a litter before being one year old. I'm spayed now and have a tattoo to prove it. 

When I met my foster parents we all feel immediately in love. They have a backyard that I love to play in and a swimming pool that I have reluctantly swum in. They have two kids ages 13 & 9 and often have friends over. I win everyone's heart and I am sooo happy to meet and greet new people with kisses. I love kids because they like to run and play with me. I'm active at the right times because I am happy to sleep in my crate, yes, I love my crate. I never bark or get upset when I'm in it. I'm a big fan of family time on the couch. I love to snuggle with my foster family and I hear snore. I'm housetrained and I'm a fast learner, sit, come, etc. My foster family had planned on being my forever family but their other female dog and I don't get along. I'm fine with their 12-year-old male dog although he isn't really a fan of me because I like to play. He says he's too old for that. 

So basically I would do best as an only dog but I'd be happy to meet you and perhaps your male dog. I probably shouldn't be in a house with cats or other small creatures as I have a pretty strong prey drive. I know these character traits may not be appealing to some but I know there is the perfect forever home out there for me. I also know that my foster family will make sure I am placed with the best of the best. They want me and my new family to live happily ever after.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43252639/1/?bust=1541818732', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43252639/2/?bust=1541818734', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43252639/3/?bust=1541818736', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43252639/4/?bust=1541818737', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43252639/5/?bust=1541818757', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43252639/6/?bust=1541818740']",Sky - COURTESY POST,43252639,F,M,A

Humphrey likes treats and walks and cuddling with or following his person around. He eats a regular diet and is housebroken to the outside.  He will sometimes bark if he hears someone walking by the door, but is generally quiet. He will growl a little if another dog tries to take his food or toy from him but shows no signs of aggression at all.  

Humphrey is a happy and very affectionate dog jumping into laps, giving kisses and wanting belly rubs.  He will a wonderful, loving  companion.  What Humphrey really does NOT like is being in a city environment, so we are seeking a suburban or country home for him, where he will be comfortable..

Other than that Russett is a happy boy who likes attention. He loves to play, run and go for long walks. He needs some help with his manners but he is a smart boy who catches on fast.

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

You donât meet dogs as sweet and well-mannered as Ellie Mae everyday! This Pyr/Anatolian Shepherd mix is loving life in her foster home and has already mastered housebreaking, made great progress on a leash, and is working on both âcomeâ and âsitâ. The best part of coming into foster has been getting to meet new people, especially children. Gentle Ellie Mae seems to understand that being a big girl she has to be extra careful with them, and she goes out of her way to do just that. She also gets along with other dogs and quickly figured out that while the senior dogs prefer naps, the dogs closer to her age enjoy playtime just as much as she does :) She loves them all so much that she even walks away from her food bowl if they want her to share. Ellie Mae isnât just a great personality; with her Pyr length coat and shepherd coloring this girl is a beauty. If you look closely, you might even notice her freckles. This girl is definitely the total package and is guaranteed to bring a lifetime of smiles to the lucky family she gets to call her own!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43452311/1/?bust=1544019190', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43452311/2/?bust=1543952557', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43452311/3/?bust=1544019190']",Ellie Mae,43452311,F,L,A

He has a blood and stool test report and an International Health Certificate. 

Bupi is a very playful and sweet dog who craves for your love. He is a social dog who gets along well with other dogs. He is waiting to have family of his own where he will be loved. If you want to give Bupi a loving home please email Rescuewithoutborders@gmail.com. 

Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:
IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.

This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years â older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.

They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.
IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.
These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.

IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.
A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 â 18 years.

This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 â 22 kgs).
They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.

In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.

Please visit our Face book page to see the IN dogs adopted through our rescue.

567,Adult,English Pointer,"Roarke comes to us from Illinois, where he was found as a very malnourished stray. He was terribly skinny and the shelter worked to get him feeling better and to put some meat back on his bones. Roarke was positive for heartworms, and he has been treated for them and will be ready for his FURever home in early December. Roarke is a DREAM on a leash and loves to go for walks, checking out his surroundings and taking in the scenery. He is also a big fan of car rides and loves to meet new friends.

Roarke is making big strides on his house manners, but sometimes he gets that ""I'm a puppy in an adult body"" sparkle in his eye and tries to instigate a game of catch me if you can! He may knock things over in these comical moments, but it isn't his fault if his tail or nicely rounded thighs topple knicknacks or thingamabobs. He likes to try to ""help"" fold laundry, especially towels but don't be surprised if he decides one is a flag to be waved!

Roarke is a VERY sweet boy who loves to give love. He likes to give hugs and can sometimes slobber in his exuberance to love people. Roarke is great with kitties and he is fine with most dogs, although dominant dogs are not something he'd like to encounter on a daily basis.

Meet Lex and Luther! They are perhaps a cattle dog / border collie / heeler mix? We really don't know, just a best guess! Anyway, they were rescued from living under an abandoned house in GA after their 'owner' moved away and left them and their momma, Lucy there! They were born approximately April 11th, 2015, They are very sweet and good with other dogs! They and their momma will be arriving to NJ on 6/14/15.
Update from foster mom 06/17/15
Sweet times 3! Momma Lucy has a very sweet disposition, itâs like she has been with us for years! She easily warmed up to us. Lex â the smaller of the 2 pups, is a ball of fire, he feels he needs to defend himself from his stocky brother Luther. Both are absolutely adorable! Anyone who adopts any of the 3 will be extremely lucky! We have fostered 3 other dogs in the past & I must admit these 3 by far are the best!!!!

'LUTHER' This cutie is ready for his new come! Another great name would be MJ (Michael Jackson) because his paws look like Michael's gloves without the glitz. He loves to play outside, yet cuddles on the couch too! He was a little skiddish when he arrived to his foster home, but is coming around. Give this Little Guy the chance to grow up in a loving home
Update from foster mom 10/21/15
LUTHER â this 6 Â½ month old pup is looking for a new foster or forever home. He is quite the cutie. Fully housebroken, neutered and crate trained. He loves to play, cuddle & give kisses. He needs a little more training with cats that is why he needs a new fosterâ¦.the weather is getting cold and itâs time for the fosterâs cats to come in for the Winter months. He gets along terrifically with other dogs and loves to go for walks. Weighing about 25 pounds he is not a big dog. He is a mix (Mother was a Blue Heeler/Aust. Cattle Dog, father unknown) although he looks like he could be part Labrador. Open your arms to this absolutely loving pup!
Luther is now a year old as of 4/21/16. Update from foster mom
Luther is 1 yr old Australian Cattle Dog mix. He is truly a great buddy. He loves cuddling. He is crate trained as well as housebroken. He is ok with cats and small dogs but not very fond of larger dogs.Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adopt","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38389301/1/?bust=1497045486', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38389301/2/?bust=1497045486', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38389301/3/?bust=1497045486']",Luther,38389301,M,M,A
578,Adult,"Terrier, Shepherd","Hmmm.  What could he be.  The mix that keeps going around is shepherd/terrier/retriever.... but this is a medium size dog (nowhere near shepherd or retriever size) with short fur.  Found the day after the July 4th fireworks we were sure someone would be looking.  So many dogs are frightened by the loud noise, and they bolt.  That means this handsome gent could be from anywhere.  We waited and waited, but no one came.  No one called.   Since kids can be very noisy and he was so very scared when he came in we're thinking an adult household might be best.  

The town vet was in and checked him out.  Now he has his rabies vaccination.

MEET SAMPSON!!

This gorgeous hound mix is actually a rescue from Antiqua! Now living in upper Manhattan, doing wonderfully.

He is a young, lovable, energetic pup seeking a new home. His ideal home would be in the country with lots of open fields to run in, but he actually  does very well in the city too as long as he gets his daily exercise. He LOVES long walks, hikes and playing fetch. 
Sampson is also very calm in the home, knows how to chill after his walk, enjoying cuddles and belly rubs. He is a total affectionate lovebug, an incredible canine who will make some one or family a wonderful companion for life!

Sampson is about a year old and weighs about 55 lbs. He is utd and neutered. 

HAVE QUESTIONS? WANT TO KNOW MORE? Please contact reboundhounds@gmail.com and we will connect you to his present guardian.

584,Senior,Beagle,"Miley is a small, female Beagle-mix. She is approximately 10 years old and weighs just 20 pounds. Miley is current on vaccinations, already spayed, heartworm neg. (on preventative), and microchipped. She is crate trained too.  Though she is very shy with strangers (and the camera), Miley is a super affectionate dog that enjoys attention and loves being fussed over and spoiled by people she trusts. She really likes to snuggle and enjoys lots of one-on-one time with her favorite people. 

She is afraid of and reactive toward dogs she doesn't know. As a result, she doesn't handle introductions very well. She would prefer to be an only dog so she wouldn't have to share her human's attention and could get all the lovin' she deserves. Miley has not been observed with cats so a home without kitties is recommended.

Miley is a sweet little girl that really likes being with the people she trusts and enjoys being pampered. She'd be a wonderful companion for an experienced adopter/dog owner that understood her needs.

IMPORTANT: Safe Hounds Beagle Rescue does not operate a shelter where the public can meet our dogs. All of our Beagles are cared for in a loving foster home.

Want to adopt me? Fill out our online adoption application by visiting our website: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

GIZMO is an approximately 3 year old male, neutered Boxer mix who weighs approximately 41 lbs. 

This handsome boy is a gem and is very affectionate with people and great with other dogs!  We think he is fine with cats and will have more details shortly.

602,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever","Hi! My name is Truly Terrific Tito and I am looking for a loving, forever home.  I was rescued by our wonderful rescue partner from the streets of Puerto Rico where I was abandoned and left to fend for myself.  I was so excited and relieved to be rescued.  I knew things were about to get alot better for me :)).  The President of our rescue met Tito at our rescue partner's home when she was in Puerto Rico and committed to finding Tito a forever home as soon as we had a foster available.  My rescuer loved and cared for me until I was ready to take my liberation flight.  I have now arrived in New York :)).

My foster family in New York City says I am a SUPER sweet dog :).  I am a good combination of playful yet calm.  I LOVE other dogs and cuddling on the couch to give and receive lots of love and affection :)).  I also walk well on a leash.  I would really enjoy a forever home with another dog and a fenced in yard.

Truly Terrific Tito is 7 years old, 51 lbs., neutered, fully vetted and vaccinated

She is a white, female, pointer/shepherd mix dog with brown spots on her ears and very pale brown spots on her fur.  She is a very unique looking dog.  Buffy is 2 and a half years old, 50 pounds, housebroken, up to date on her vaccinations, spayed, micro-chipped and heartworm negative.  She also has the most gorgeous white eye lashes. She knows how to sit and will do so when asked.  She is a little shy but loves giving and getting love. She is so sweet and loving. 

Buffy came from a kill shelter in Georgia where her time was almost up.  Since coming into rescue she has shown no aggression but only sweetness.  She is a high energy dog who loves to play with her toys, including balls and hard bones which she loves to bite on.  She takes her treats very gently.  We believe that she would be great with children, but care should be taken with  young children who could be knocked over by accident through play.  

Buffy is fine and friendly with other dogs and enjoys running around and playing with them here.  A secure fenced yard would be a must for this dog so she could run safely free.  We don't know how she is with cats.  Buffy is so loving and sweet and is so deserving of a loving home. Please give her a chance. 

If u think Buffy might be a good match for your family,  please send me an application to Save Us Dog Rescue at fries3@aol.com   Buffy is so deserving of a forever, loving home.

Iâve been learning to be potty-trained, need a little extra practice with leash-walks and am fine with crates (for a short amount of time). Iâm good with dogs and kids, but due to my tiny size, I should be adopted into a home with older kids only. Itâs unknown how I am around cats I havenât been introduced to them yet.

Want to adopt adorable Peanut?  Fill out our online adoption application by visiting our website: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

Thank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43379241/1/?bust=1544590418', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43379241/2/?bust=1544590418', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43379241/3/?bust=1544590419', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43379241/4/?bust=1544590419']",Peanut,43379241,M,S,A

Poor Charlie was a stray dog who showed up at the home of a family who lived out in the country. They let him stay there for a few years, mostly living outside, but now they don't have the money or the desire to care for Charlie any longer.

Hearing this story, EHR felt that Charlie deserved better - he deserved a second chance at a REAL life. We want to find him a wonderful home where he can actually live INSIDE a house & know how it feels to be really loved and cared for. He will be arriving at EHR on January 24th & we hope he will have a family waiting to meet him.

Charlie is a 4-5 year old Airedale Terrier mix who weighs about 50 pounds. He is friendly with dogs and all people, young & old, but we don't know if he's been exposed to cats.

Please give Charlie the one thing he has never had - a loving ""forever home"" where he can be a part of the family, knowing love & giving love in return.

The girls had a home since they were little puppies. Sadly, they were given up due to their family circumstances changing and their owners moving to different places. The girls have never been away from their home so shelter life was tough on them at first, but they are putting the past behind them and are focused on winning the hearts of a wonderful new family. They are very outgoing, well-socialized ladies that just adore people of all ages. They grew up with kids and are just fine with them. They will, however, need a home with no other dogs. They adore each other and need to stay together forever. They are well behaved, well trained, and still have plenty of spunk and playfulness about them. You will love these two gentle giants the moment you meet them. File#28170/71 5/15/18

622,Adult,Jack Russell Terrier,"Barney is a courtesy post for his human. For serious inquiries, please contact the owner whose information is below. Thank you

Barney is a neutered, energetic, 8 year old JRT. He is very handsome and smart. He started having seizures when he was about 2 years old and takes 15 mg phenobarbital twice a day. He has been seizure free since December 2016 and his phenobarbital levels are therapeutic. He is up to date on his vaccinations and is heart-worm negative. 

He loves going for walks and is great on a leash, and loves to play catch in the yard. He has had obedience training and knows how to sit, stay, place, come, leave it (toy) and we still work on lay. He is also crate trained, and house broken.

He has shown signs of dominance and corrects by nipping us and house guests. He has nipped (no blood drawn) everyone except our toddler (fortunately) but we have had too many close calls even though we try our best to keep them separated . He has nipped at houseguests despite us telling them not to pet him, since he doesnât like it. He does not shows signs of food aggression and when he nips, he has not broken skin and no blood. 

He would do best in a home with a strong leader and without young children or cats.

624,Baby,"Shepherd, Boston Terrier","Meet the River Litter! This group of pups all named after Rivers are ready to find their forever homes here in New Jersey. They are 3-month-old Boston Terrier/Shepherd mixes. Some of this litter look more on the Boston Terrier side whereas others resemble Shepherds. These pups are as sweet as they come. They enjoy playing with each other, chewing on squeaky toys 3 times their size, and running around in their foster's backyard. They are working super hard on becoming house, leash, and crate trained. They are all getting better and better day by day. This wonderful group of puppies cannot wait to find individual forever families of their very own.

The River Litter is spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and microchipped. 

Home for Good Dog Rescue (HFGDR) is a 100 percent foster-based rescue located in Summit with offices in Berkeley Heights, NJ.

So You Want to Fosterâ¦FAQ

*Financial Responsibility â The Rescue provides food, vet care, medications and equipment.  You may need a collar, leash and ID tag.  The financial cost to you, of fostering and saving lives, is often nothing and always minimal.  We provide the material needs, you provide the home and heart. 

*Commitment â The required time is 10-14 days based on the age of the pup(s) and vaccination records.  A typical foster period is usually 2-3 weeks, occasionally a little shorter or longer, depending on the needs of your pup.

*Frequency â There is a scheduled arrival of dogs and pups in need every month, with occasional needs at other times that cannot be anticipated. Your commitment is only ever for each foster period you volunteer for. 
 
*Adopting your Foster â If you are hoping to adopt, please be sure to speak with the Rescue and fill in an adoption application.  Often we have approved families waiting for pups, so knowing prior to fostering is very important and helps with placement.  

*Support â The Rescue provides support from start to finish.  We provide a foster packet, an adoption folder with documents for review, an adoption checklist, and a group of volunteers and fosters that help in a variety of ways.
 
*Household Dynamic â We always do our best to ensure a good foster experience for you and your family.  We of course hope that your experience will be SO good that you will want to volunteer to foster again!  One of the ways we do that is to learn a little about your home, family and pets.  This helps us place dogs and puppies that will be a good foster match in your home while we all work together to find their forever homes!

*Distance and Travel â You would be required to come to the Marlton, NJ area to meet an arrival transport to pick up your pup, visit the vet if needed.  Picking up additional supplies, if it became necessary may also be required.  Occasionally, a pup may need to get to a clinic, event, or a volunteer for vaccines.  Most of our foster homes are within an hour or so of the Collingswood area. 

*Foster Assignments â We do our best to match foster pups with foster families.  Final assignments are made within a few days of arrival, but can change even as close as the day before arrival if a dog cannot come on transport.  Sometimes we ask you to take a specific dog that we would like to rescue. Once you commit to a dog, the Rescue commits.  We can only take as many dogs as we have foster homes for. 

*First Step â If you have come this far, and are ready to move forward, then itâs time to fill out the Foster Application and submit it for approval.  References will be called, a vet check will be done, and you will receive a call for a foster interview.

He is on several medications, a prescription allergy diet and medicated baths, and is looking for a home where he will get the continued special care he needs.  He gets along with other dogs and is such a friendly little guy!


And another neglect case...this guy isnât even a senior although his condition makes him look like one:(.  3 year old Lhasa Simba was surrendered today because his owners realized his medical bills were going to be more than they could afford.  He was kept mostly outside, is emaciated, has untreated dry eye and an old injury to one of his eyes, severe ear infections and skin infections that caused half his hair to fall out.  This didnât happen overnight... heâs been quietly suffering for a long time.  Despite his discomfort he has been nothing but sweet with the vet and staff treating him and already looks, smells and feels so much better after an emergency medicated bath and some treatment.  Little Simba has a long road ahead of him, will need eye drops for life and continued medicated baths and ear treatment for a while... 
please email njwoof@cs.com to foster Simba during his recovery or adopt once he is ready.

We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East, Morris Plains, NJ.

He loves being out for long walks, and does enjoy playing with his toys, but doesn't always want to share them with you:) So an experienced owner would be better, and no small children, older children that understand not to take a toy away, or bother him while playing, eating or sleeping. After all, no one likes to be disturbed when sleeping or even eating! Overall he really has a very sweet temperament, and for his size, can be so gentle. When he wants you to pet him he will gently raise his paw to you. Peanut so deserves to be in a home where he can love and be loved forever.

The Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39712209/1/?bust=1545120605', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39712209/2/?bust=1545120651', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39712209/3/?bust=1545120682']",Peanut,39712209,M,M,A
647,Adult,Mixed Breed,"My name is Bleu, I'm a 3-5 year old Shepard mix with more love to give than I know what to do with. I love playing outside in my own yard and just lying on the couch with my favorite person. I am housebroken and crate trained. My foster mom says I have a lot of personality, and with the right home I am going to be someone's best friend. I would do best in a house as the only dog, with a fenced in yard. I am eager to please you and hope you will consider adopting me!

Bleu is an alpha dog who is not good around other dogs. She needs a home with NO other animals, a backyard with a secure, 6-foot fence to keep her safely contained, and loving, but watchful adopters to keep her from other dogs and all to themselves. Bleu is under 30 pounds and would make a great companion for the right home. Bleu is spayed and up to date on all vaccinations. Her adoption also includes free in home training to her new family.

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

If you love Great Pyreness, you will most certainly love Jasper, a young boy believed to be a purebred Great Pyrenees. Jasper wears the Pyrenees' signature white, long fluffy coat like a king, and he absolutely loves it when his humans take the time to brush out any dirt or knots from his beautiful fur. He also takes his job as a guardian seriously; he is confident and he radiates an air of importance. Jasper feels that barking is a nuisance that should be kept to a minimum, so he doesn't feel the need to vocalize often. He is totally ready for his furever home...he walks very well on leash, is very respectful of fencing, and will even come when called! We believe this young boy will do well in a relatively quiet home either as an only dog, or with a female companion of similar size.

SPECIAL NEEDS FOSTER HOME NEEDED FOR A VERY SPECIAL BOY! 

Last week a very special boy named Kubo came into our rescue. Kubo is a very sweet, gentle 2 year old boy whose owner sadly could not keep. We were informed that he occasionally will drop little ""presents"" unknowingly.  Upon arrival to his temporary foster home, it was discovered that Kubo has little bowel control and some bladder leakage. We are in need of a special foster who is willing to  care for him while we address his medical needs. He will need a full medical work up and a consult with an neurologist for starters. His temporary foster mom reports that Kubo is a sweet, qentle, mild mannered house guest.  We hope that his wonderful personality and good looks will have fosters lining up!

659,Baby,"Dachshund, Labrador Retriever","Macy, affectionately called ""Tiny Momma"" by her foster family, is truly a dream.  This poor girl came to us after she was surrendered to a SC kill shelter with her mother, father, and brother because their family was moving.  At only 9 months old, this girl was already pregnant with her first (and last!) litter.  Macy's mother is a 48 lb. Black Lab mix, and her father is a 12 lb. Doxie/Terrier mix.  At her normal weight (not pregnant or full of milk!), she will probably weigh about 25 lbs. and has the long and low Doxie build.

Darling Macy has been an amazing mother to her puppies, but it is now time to begin the search for her loving forever home.  Macy wormed her way into the hearts of her entire foster family very quickly, with her wagging tail and wiggles of joy.  She wants nothing more than to sit and cuddle with her humans on the couch and will even fall asleep on them.  Macy gets along beautifully with the other dogs in her foster home and has a blast playing with them.  She can even hold her own very well with the bigger dogs in her foster home (and isn't afraid to put a rude dog in their place).

Cutest of all, however, is when she takes every single toy out of the toy box to bring to her bed.  Macy is very content to lay on her bed and play with her toys there, and she redirects very well to toys when she is chewing on something she's not supposed to.  With her being a mother so young, it is easy for people to forget that this tiny momma is still a puppy herself; she is working on not jumping on people when she's excited or wants attention.  She adores her family (human and canine) and is the most delicious snuggler.  Macy brings so much joy to everyone she is with, whether she's giving you love or you're watching her toss a squeaky toy around with pure joy - she is amazing! 

Macy is house trained, knows ""sit"", comes when called, walks well on a leash, and sleeps through the night perfectly. 


Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (http://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (http://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

She is extremely sweet, gentle & very laid back & has a pure delight personality wise. Her coat is a lovely shade of red, extremely shiny & she is so soft when you pet her and those VELVET ears are so wonderful to touch! Hounds always have ears that feel like velvet.
She just loves kids & we hope that she is adopted in a family with kids or grandkids & maybe another dog around her age to play with. She does LOVE to play.
As a foster Mom, I'm not 'supposed' to have favorites but Cori does have my heart. She is SO loving, SO sweet, SO funny, has tons of personality & that tail of hers is constantly thumping with joy & she has a wiggle butt that just doesnât stop.

Once she settles in she stays put & thankfully she doesn't snore! She is what we call a true 'Constant Companion' as she just wants to be close to anyone who will pay attention to her.
Bassett have short legs, so you just canât stop smiling when you see her waddle when playing outside with her fostering siblings. When she comes in from outside she does another cute thing that I havenât seen before â she runs in & does a sort of baseball slide on the carpet!
Her favorite thing to do is find her way to the sofa, chair & what she loves best is being allowed to get in bed & snuggling. For her sake, I would only want to adopt her to a family that like me, allows dogs on the sofa & in bed â of course only as long as they are not wet or muddy.
Donât think by looking at her photos that sheâs sad â thatâs just how they look. There are several cute videos below so you can how pretty she is!
Cori had a pretty horrible start in love with abuse & neglect when she was in KY but she has come a long way to being the cutest adorable little girl. It took over a month for me to gain her trust & then I got to see the dog she was meant to be & she shows me the joy in her spirit. Yet, when meeting new people at first she remembers that her previous owner beat her so she still gets nervous, but she warms up very quickly as long I assure her everything is just fine. It was so sad being her foster mom because she used to just fall to the ground with fear --- but now she is so comfortable living in a home with a family that she sleeps on her back which proves she trusts me and now she can trust others. She is not a fear-biter, so you donât have to worry about that. Still, sheâll need an experienced family that will understand she has been through a lot in her short life.
Cori had been adopted but she had an 8-year old Beagle sister who did not want to play with her or even be on the same sofa with her & growled at her every day for about 6 months. One day they got into a fight & had to be separated. Iâve lived with over 550 dogs in my home, so I know them very well. I think what happened is just like a human, Cori got fed up with her sister growling all the time. Obviously, she had to be returned to me. She gets along with everyone here in my home, you can see that in the videos below. My feeling is that she can be adopted with another dog, but a dog who is submissive and around her age so it will want to play with her.
Cori did test positive for a tick-borne disease Ehrlichiosis which is like Lyme. She has never had any symptoms, just tested positive & is not sick. My Vet had her complete a 6-week course of antibiotics just to be cautious that she can remain symptom-free.
If she sounds like the kind of girl you would love to bring into your home, be sure to read our adoption requirements which are listed on the left side of our website. If you can meet or exceed you can apply online.

666,Adult,"Rottweiler, American Staffordshire Terrier","Please note, this is a courtesy listing for our sister rescue group, the SPCA of Westchester. This dog is located at the SPCA at 590 North State Road in Briarcliff Manor, NY 10510 (www.spca914.org). Please apply with the SPCA if you are interested in this dog, please read the details below!

Cookie is truly a smart cookie -- she's aced her B.A. and M.A. level tests in our Canine Life and Social Skills training program; now she's working toward her PhD! Being a C.L.A.S.S. graduate means that Cookie gets a neat ribbon and YOU get a really well-trained pup!

Cookie is a 7 year old girl who's a big, happy goofball. Cookie loves her people friends -- loyalty is the name of the game with this girl, and she will make a terrific companion. Cookie's ideal home would be with a person or people who will continue her training (she enjoys challenging that big brain of hers), and where she'll get equal parts outdoor fun time and indoor cuddle time. Cookie loves being active and playful (she's on the SPCA Trail team and would make a terrific jogging partner), but she's also great at chilling out and relaxing by herself. She frequently has sleepovers in our trainer's office and is always a model tenant. Cookie is such an easygoing, good sport that she's our go-to gal for dressing up in costume, as you can see from some of her photos! Cookie is selective with her dog friends and would most likely like to live as an only dog (she also does not want to live with cats). 

Cookie is eligible for Critter Credit -- $250 to spend on sessions with a recommended trainer or for a gift card to Petco or Petsmart! Plus, her adoption fee has already been paid by a volunteer who adores her AND she will be going home with a massive goodie bag that includes a bed, her favorite treats and toys, a harness and collar, and a few coats and sweaters to get her wardrobe started!

669,Adult,Great Dane,"Roxy is a sweet 7 year old black natural eared female who was surrendered by her family because they did not have time to care for her any longer.  She came in to MAGDRL extremely emaciated and thin and with a terrible infection of her paws and pads.  She has been on steroids and antibiotics and her foster home is working hard with the vet to get her feet healed and healthy again.  We believe her foot infection may be allergy related so she was started on a grain free diet with salmon and sweet potato.  We may have to have her tested for allergies if we canât get her feet to heal.  She is slowly putting on some weight, she was only 87 lbs when she came in. She is in a foster home with a female lab mix and they get along well.  She is slowly coming out of her shell and getting more playful.  Roxy is pretty mellow and very affectionate.  She walks well on a leash.  Until we can get a handle on her paw issue, she will be on medical hold.  Roxy came to MAGDRL in January of 2018.

675,Young,"German Shepherd Dog, Siberian Husky","Maia is a year old German Shepherd/ Siberian Husky/Wolf mix. Maia and her sister Mira had little socialization or training before coming to us, resulting in a shy, more aloof temperament with unfamiliar people. With people she knows, Maia is very playful, affectionate, and can be mischievous. She needs a lot of training to be indoors as, like most young dogs, she just wants to grab, chew, and investigate everything she comes across. She has limited experience indoors and would need a committed, patient owner willing to guide her through potty training. 

Maia does very well with other dogs of the opposite gender, often following their lead and would do best with an outgoing male companion dog to help socialize her to new people. She enjoys going for hikes and walks on the secluded trails on our property and does well on leash. She has not had much experience in the car and does get car sick. 

Maia requires at least a 6 foot wooden privacy or chain link fence. Please no small pets such as cats. She is part wolf and will only be adopted to areas where wolfdogs are legal to own.

678,Young,Australian Shepherd,"Zayne is just over a year old weighing in at about 45 pounds. His coat is a bit shorter than a typical aussie, but he is still so soft. Zayne aims to please his humans and loves, loves, LOVES to cuddle and be pet. He is very responsive to commands and catches on quickly. He is a very powerful runner and enjoys fetching the ball for his human, inside and outside.

Zayne's behavior towards other dogs is hit-or-miss; He co-exists alongside his foster brother but doesn't show a lot of interest in playing with him. He growls at other dogs and has gone after them in a non-playing manner. He cannot be trusted to run free in dog parks because of his unpredictable behavior. Zayne has shown signs of improvement though so he may get to the point where he can be nice around other dogs consistently.

Zayne does great on the leash and rides nicely in the car. We are not sure how he does with cats, but he does like to chase squirrels now and then. Zayne loves to tear dog toys to shreds so he will need some heavy duty toys and bones. He is crate trained, although he may not enjoy being in the crate.

He can have a high energy level, but also settles down quickly and is happy to sit with you on the sofa. He will climb on to your lap, thinking he is a tiny lap dog.

He is well-bonded, and was surrendered with his housemate, Tanya. We would LOVE to keep this family together. Fernando is a companion dag and would do best in a home with a family who would be home more often.

If you're interested in adopting Fernando, please first read about our adoption process under the *ADOPT* tab at www.happypawsrescue.org. Then, complete an adoption application found under the same tab and email it to happypawsrescue@gmail.com. Fernando will be at our adoption day events on SUNDAYS from 12-3 p.m. at the Piscataway, NJ Petco. ***PLEASE NOTE: We will not be at Petco for the remainder of 2018, but will return in January. Happy holidays!*** Thank you for your interest in adopting!

***Let us introduce you toâ¦ the American Shelter Dog! When we look at dogs of unknown parentage, such as this beautiful pup, the best we can do is guess at their breed, and it turns out that even dog experts are usually wrong when doing so. Itâs been shown that nearly 90 percent of shelter dogs visually identified as a particular breed/mix are mislabeled. Please understand that it is impossible to reliably identify the breed(s) or predict the behavior of dogs solely on the basis of their appearance. Though we may not know their blend, we do know that the love of a rescued dog is without boundaries and touches all those in its reach, often transforming the rescuee into the rescuer!***

Thinking about adopting me? Hereâs how:
1. Fill out an application found at www.happypawsrescue.org under the *ADOPT* tab. 
2. Email it to happypawsrescue@gmail.com.
3. Please allow a few days for us to review and respond to your application. 
4. Approved applicants will be invited to come meet me at adoption day.

She is shy with strangers and needs a quiet, calm home with no children and few visitors, in a rural setting with a big yard and other dogs to play with. Her foster mom says this about her: ""

While Lily needs some time to get u

Description: Meet Bella. Bella has had a tough start - we believe she was used for breeding and surrendered when she didnât live up her ownerâs expectations. She was surrendered while in the throws of a miscarriage, after just recently having a litter, and has now been spayed. Bella can be shy when first meeting people, but once sheâs settled in, sheâs a very confident young dog. She uses both wee pads and goes to the bathroom outdoors, although still has occasional accidents, and will need continued housebreaking. She loves other dogs, and plays very well with them. Sheâs gentle around cats, and although she can get overexcited and chase them at times, she has never shown aggression and backs off once she realizes her playing is unwelcome. She is extremely social, and loves to stay by your side. She does well with children, and is very gentle and non-destructive. She is still very young at just a year old and loves to play. We donât know what her mix is. She appears the be mostly yorkie and does not shed, but we cannot know with certainty whether or not she is truly hypoallergenic. She is a sweetheart ready and deserving of her perfect forever home.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43567925/1/?bust=1545080854', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43567925/2/?bust=1545080856']",Bella,43567925,F,S,A
703,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Jasper's boarding mom tells us: 
Generally, I go for the tall, dark and handsomes, but there's something about this dreamboat that makes me want to cross over to the other side! 
Jasper is totally my kind of guy. Confident, strong, affectionate, playful, goofy, makes me laugh... what's not to love here? He narrowly escaped being euthanized at the Manhattan shelter in June, then came down with serious pneumonia and once again was in a fight for his life. But like a champ, this babe pulled through and he is ready to find the yin to his yang. 
While Jasper is all of those wonderful things I mentioned above, he is not for a first time dog owner. He needs a capable leader who will be present and continue to provide him with mental and physical stimulation. He's no pushover and though I do play with him, he knows I am in charge at all times. He's iffy with other dogs, some we pass and he play bows, others he gets stiff so he would either need to be an only dog or interactions must take place prior to him leaving. Cats unknown and teens over 15 would be best. 
Jasper came a long way from his stay at the shelter. He is urgently in need of a foster or adopter. Remember dogs who once were in danger are still sometimes in need. Jasper is about 4 years old, UTD and neutered.

706,Adult,Chihuahua,"Meet Butterscotch! This 12-pound female is around 5 years old, and just landed in NYC from LA. She is very sweet and cuddly but also super friendly and energetic. Butterscotch was so excited for her first walk in the city and was happily checking out everything, especially the new smells. She can apparently jump pretty high, too! Butterscotch runs and leaps into people's arms - pretty impressive trick! This overall happy girl walks great on a leash and loves sitting in her foster mom's lap. She is good with her foster fur-sibling and is a total lovebug! Butterscotch is micro-chipped, vaccinated, and spayed.

722,Young,"Mixed Breed, Pit Bull Terrier","Rascal was abandoned and tied up under the blazing sun. Local cops found him in a parking lot, looking defeated. He was so thin and frail that an officer lifted what should be a strong, majestic pit bull with one arm like a feather. They took him to The Veterinary Emergency and Referral Group, where he awaited transport to a high kill shelter. The employees at VERG knew his fate at the kill shelter, so they called us up and asked us to take the case. Remembering other pit bulls that we took care of like Norman and Lola, we knew that Rascal could have the same happy ending and we would be betraying our duty as rescuers to turn him away from that chance. We welcomed him to the AMA family and rushed him to our vets at Noah's Ark Veterinary Practice to see what was going on with this poor dog of just skin and bones. Based off of the medical exam we were able to tell that he had been through a lot of trauma, especially for his young age. He developed deep pressure wounds from being pressed against the walls of a small space for a long time and was also covered in dozens of other wounds that resembled bite marks. Weeks in medical boarding Rascal's playfulness started to come out. It was time for him to leave the clinic and go to a foster home. We were so excited to watch Rascal thrive and eventually getting adopted. But unfortunately, that wasn't his happily ever after. A year later his adopters returned him to us as they were no longer able to care for him. It was a very sad news, but we didn't give up Rascal then and we are not about to give up on him now. Rascal is healthy and happy with us,  and we know that his true forever family will show up any day now!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43488550/1/?bust=1544284388', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43488550/2/?bust=1544284396', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43488550/3/?bust=1544284404', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43488550/4/?bust=1544284433', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43488550/5/?bust=1544284441', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43488550/6/?bust=1544284447']",Rascal,43488550,M,L,A

732,Adult,Shih Tzu,"Jolie is a sweet 8 1/2 year old, white and tan Shih Tzu who weighs about 11 pounds.

She is still fearful and will cower when you put on her leash for a walk, but once it is on she is ready and willing to go. Jolie sleeps on the big bed and is getting better with being picked up to be placed on it. She loves to be in the same room as you, but she is not a snuggle bug yet.

Hi everyone! Iâm Lyrical (rhymes with Miracle) at least that is what the Folks at Wags call me. I am about a year and a half old, a light weight 40 pounds (I know, I look bigger than that), but if you meet me you will say oh your a little girl. I am on the smaller side for my breed and one of the leaner ones. Some of the things that are typical of my breed- I am super sweet! I just want to meet every human and every dog I see. Also I like to be with my foster mom, everywhere she goes, I like to keep her company. Also I am a licker, I am not sure what exactly that means, but from what I understand some people will love it, and some people eh,not so much. Also I am a super duper snuggler, if snuggling were an Olympic sport, I would definitely get a medal in snuggling. I try to snuggle the resident dog, but he is very independent (I do not know what that means) I just know that when I try to lay by him he gets up and walks away. I know I sound like a really great dog, right? I am a young girl though so there are some things I am working on, one is I still have accidents in the house :( I donât mean to, by the time foster mom realizes I am giving her my signals she has to put a leash on me and take me out, she thinks if I had a fenced yard I would do much better with that. Also I am still a little mouthy, we are working on that and I am so much better than I was even a week ago! I am also getting a lot better on a leash. So, yea, I am not perfect, but if you think I am perfect for you, contact the folks at Wags Rescue. I look forward to meeting you!

Introducing Lyrical!  This one and a half year old, forty pound, pit mix found her name because she was in need of a miracle when we found her - and Lyrical rhymed with miracle!  She has will need an FHO surgery to repair her hip - possible damage from trauma or being hit by a car.  Many dogs are in need of this surgery and recover well.  We have no reason to believe she will not recover perfectly as well.  Since coming into rescue, she has been working on her house and leash training and has done well with both!  She loves to nap on the couch with her two or four legged friends.  She still has some puppy habits that sheâs working on breaking such as nibbling on toes and hands, but sheâs learning that she canât do that.  She would love to be in a home with older kids as she loves to play.  She rides well in the car and is learning house rules quickly.  She met a kitten recently and we learned that she is a little too interested in cats, so it would be best if she could find a feline free home!  Her foster mom says that Lyrical is a perfect name for her as she is a talker and will tell you what she thinks if sheâs not getting lots of attention and love!  She also enjoys watching TV and her favorite person is LL Cool J!  Every time he is on TV she sits right up by it and watches the TV.   Lyrical is fully vetted and has been spayed.  She is now in search of her forever family and would like to meet you!  If you are interested in adopting Lyrical, please fill out an application on our website at www.wagsrescue.com!

Jewel is such a sweetheart, loves to be carried, to be in your lap, under your feet and genuinely always wants to be with her people.

Captain is a calm sweetheart who loves to cuddle, especially when he thinks you donât realize.

He is the sweetest boy who will love you and watch out for you forever. Raleigh is an energizer bunny who never stops moving. She loves to play and spend time with you, and will always try to smother you with kisses. She loves everyone and everything. Captain and Raleigh are best friends, and can entertain themselves by playing with each other for hours. They are both crate-trained and house-trained, and full of personality.

741,Senior,American Bulldog,"Max is a big mush of a dog that enjoys the attention of people and smiles from ear to ear when you talk to him. He loves going for a ride in the car and makes the best co-pilot, ever!! Max the Mush has been at the kennel for almost 7 years! His favorite volunteer friend cannot understand why. It is truly heartbreaking. Max is soo loving and loyal!! He is great in the car, loves walks, his toys, and is food motivated!

Max is approximately 9 years old, but he acts much younger. The high stress environment of the kennel is no place for him to live out the rest of his life. He has not had very many opportunities to interact with other dogs so he would likely do best in a single pet house unless we could find the perfect match of a doggie sibling. Max has met a volunteer's dog and did well with her; even showing signs of wanting to play.

The ideal home for Max would be quiet without many visitors. He would do best with older, respectful kids as he gives big, rough kisses that may startle or knock over a younger child. Max would also need someone who is willing to take it slowly with him and willing to meet him several times before bringing him home. He is such a gem that continuously gets overlooked. He has so much love to give, we promise you will not need anything else if you have Max. He always has the biggest smile on his face, too. Please consider Max!

If you're willing to take a chance on Max, you will be rewarded with a loyal & trusting friend. Please consider giving Max a home to live out his golden years!

744,Adult,Mixed Breed,"Sundae is not with the SPCA of Westchester. Please contact ""For the Love of Dogs"" Rescue for more information. www.fortheloveofdogsrescue.org

Sugary deliciously sweet like an ice cream sundae.. Sundae got her name because of how friendly and snuggly she is! Also because her beautiful coat looks like melted chocolate and vanilla ice cream swirled together. Sundaeâs unique coloring is caused from a cosmetic skin disorder called vitiligo. Vitiligo only affects the pigment of the skin and hair.. causing it to progressively turn white over time. Check out her photos and pigment of her nose... How cool!! She will have ever morphing markings. Even cooler.. Michael Jackson had the condition and so does our dog trainer Jamie!

Sundae seems like a real adventurer and to love the outdoors.. she would make a fabulous jogging or hiking partner! In turn, we have also come to observe that Sundae is a real sucker for a comfy couch! Her crate is located right next to the couch in the living room of the House area. Every time she passes that couch she pops right up and slides her head into the crease while she waits for some good ole belly rubs! Sundae is a real people dog. She LOVES the company of humans and thrives on affection. What a doll Sundae is!!

747,Young,English Pointer,"Hey there, Buddy here. Yes, I'm the one formally known as Gastly. I know, a truly Gastly name right? My family (the Tennessee 12? Tennessee 9) were all named after pokemon characters by the Tennessee shelter we found ourselves living at.  Then I moved to Minnesota and my foster mom started calling me Buddy while trying to come up with something better and eventually it just kind of stuck. Keep in mind I will never actually know my name as I am almost completely deaf. Its congenital deafness due to my white coloring. So foster mom has called me #dogwhowillneverknowhisname .
I am actually mostly white with some ticking. But I have a heart shaped liver spot behind my left eye.

I am a puppy, about a year old. So, I have a TON of puppy energy, think of Tigger, Pooh's friend. Boing, Boing, Boing!  I am housebroken which is a pretty great thing. Although sometimes when I want to go out I just sit by the door. and since I am as silent as a ghost you may not know. Sometimes, however, I just crash into the door!

I really like my crate, and am crate trained. It is just like having my own bedroom. My crate needs to be an open air wire type of crate.. I do not like enclosed crates. if you put me into an enclosed crate, I will destroy it. Doesn't matter if its plastic, or canvas etc... if its enclosed it will never function again after I am done with it. And because I consider it to be my bedroom if you leave the door open I will go in on my own when I am tired. If you need me to go in when I am not ready just throw a couple training treats in on my bed and I will go in, no problem.

I am very submissive to other dogs. But will also run and play to my hearts content after I get to know them a little bit. I am also a little submissive with some men for a short period. once they rub my belly I am golden. But I am spectacular with kids. My foster sister just turned 8. and she consistently has other kids over to play. Who also like to play with me. I'm not sure how I am around cats. but if they are anything like chickens I will probably want to play with them.

I am learning a few hand signs and am also learning how to walk on a leash, this is training in progress. Because I am super strong I would rather pull you through our walk then walk by your side.

I am still in my chew everything phase of life. Nothing is off limits. Card board boxes are a random favorite to shred if I don't have enough chew toys.

I also like to counter surf. So, if your really looking forward to that peanut butter sandwich or those fries from McDonalds.... don't leave them within 12 inches of the edge of the counter. Because I will DEFINITELY have them eaten in seconds. again, work in progress.

I definitely need a taller then 4 feet fence in the yard. I am long and I am also fast which makes me a great hurdler. It would probably be helpful to have a GPS collar for me. Im not really a flight risk. But if I get out of my yard, I wont respond to you ""calling"" me back. My foster mom was a bit nervous taking me to the off leash dog park the first time. But I just like to run and play and jump and run some more and then when I am done I just walk back to her.

I'm a bit on the skinny side at 44 pounds. The pretty lady vet said I need about 5 more pounds and I will be perfect. I'm really pretty healthy, up to date on my shots, I even got a 6 month shot of proheart , heartworm preventative (Heartworm Negative). And I am neutered to boot. That has not effected my energy level in the slightest. Plus I have a microchip.

Thanks for reading about me, I hope to meet you soon.

This 7-year-old sweetheart has a wonderful demeanor and is easygoing and low maintenance.  She didnât have much going for herself - she was a pregnant stray about to be euthanized.  We rescued Minnie so that she could have her babies in a safe environment and the whole family joined us here at Pound Dog. 
Minnie was an amazing momma to her babies, who were all adopted.  Her favorite pastime - squirrel patrol, walks, and being your sofa companion.  At 20 pounds sheâs a perfect small size!!  Did we mention she loves going on walks?  Do you?
Minnie would love to be an only dog so she can lap up all the attention for herself.  She can live with other dogs but they seem to stress her.  She loves people and makes herself comfortable with them and even welcomes strangers.  A fenced yard would be perfect for her - we want her to be able to go on ""patrol""  in safe surroundings.
Minnie is house trained and crate trained, spayed and up to date with vaccinations.  She has had a recent dental cleaning to show off her beautiful smile!
Minnie has years of love and companionship to give and sheâs waiting for a family to call her own.  Please consider opening your heart to an older dog! Applications at www.pounddogfounddog.org or contact pdfdrescue@hotmail.com for more information.

Quick Introduction to Milton

Hi, Iâm Milton! Iâm super-small in size and extra-large in sweetness. The first thing I ask of you is to read my story from start to finish â promise you wonât stop in between or even at the next sentence. You see, Iâm blind, and you may not have any experience in having a blind dog. Itâs amazing what blind dogs are capable ofâ¦ it may be beyond your comprehension right now, but itâs not beyond mine, because I am living proof! In humans, vision is their most well-developed sense, but in dogs, smell is the primary sense. I can assure you that my smelling capabilities are at the top of the charts (especially when my kibble or treats are on the agenda!). Yes, there are precautions, commands, and adaptations that need to be made when you have a blind dog. And once you understand what they are, we get into our groove, and I learn the navigation of the house (my safe place) and our routine, there may be some moments Iâm getting around so well that you actually forget Iâm blind. With the set-up Iâm provided in my foster home, I navigate very well, and they continue to teach me commands to help me navigate even better. When none of the humans are home, I stay in a large pen or have free roam of a gated area with my doggie companions. Sometimes I hang out with the other doggies; other times I do my own thing, like nap in my bed with a cuddly blanket. When my humans are home, I love being near them â whether itâs staying close by while theyâre doing household things or lounging on the couch while they watch TV (and I make sure to listen, so I know whatâs happening on our favorite shows). Besides my lack of vision, Iâm a low-maintenance guy. I promise to love my forever person with all of my heart, and Iâm looking for that special someone to be completely open to my embrace.

âBetter to be blind and see with your heart, than to have two good eyes and see nothing.â

Miltonâs Background

I sadly ended up at an inner-city shelter and was at risk of being euthanized. One of Rescue Havenâs volunteers heard about my urgent situation and brought me to safety â right into the arms, heart and home of their rescue group. Iâm completely grateful and beyond happy to feel safe and loved by this wonderful group of people. I was underweight when I was first rescued, but with my good appetite, Iâm eating well, and all 7 pounds of me have filled out nicely (wink)!

Miltonâs Typical Day in Foster Home

Did you ever hear the expression, âitâs raining cats and dogsâ? Well in my foster home, itâs definitely raining dogs! There are three dogs who live there permanently, there are three other dogs (fosters like me) who live there temporarily, and there are two human parents. Now that I think about it, itâs kind of like a 2017 animal-friendly version of the Brady Bunch (groovy)! All of us wake up before sunrise to start our day. Weâre taken outside to do potty, and when back inside, we sit down as a family to eat breakfast (giggle)! Actually, we each have our own eating spotsâ¦ mine is in a large pen which gives me my own safe space to consume my food and nutrients (breakfast of champions). I continue to hang out in my pen while my foster mom gets ready for work. After she leaves, my foster dad, who works from home (A.K.A., heâs home all day), brings me into his studio, and I keep him company. We go out for walks to explore the neighborhood and get some exercise, and before you know it, itâs time to eat dinner and for my foster mom to come home. We go for one more walk at night before itâs time to lounge on the couch with my humans and canine companions. When bedtime comes upon us, I have my own cozy bed in my foster parentâs room. Their bedroom is on the second floor so they make sure to have a gate at the top of the stairs so Iâm safe and sound while we get a good nightâs rest. I typically sleep like an angel, and if I need them for some reason, they know Iâll give a little bark as my sign (woof).

Living with Milton

As mentioned above, I live with other dogs, and I get along well with them. Iâm just not very interactive with other canines, but itâs nice to know theyâre around. I enjoy doing my own thing â like napping on my bed with my blankie. A quiet home would be best as I can start to bark a bit if there is a lot of stimulus around me. We feel Iâd do fine either being the only dog in the house or having other small doggie companions (Iâd definitely smell them and most likely follow them around with my nose). Iâll need someone who will care for me regarding my blindness. You can check out this website which provides useful information regarding blind dogs. Itâs one of those things that you donât really think about until itâs right under your nose (an appropriate metaphor), but youâll see that doing specific things can help a dog like me easily became part of your forever family http://www.blinddogs.net/tips_help.html

Miltonâs Medical

Some people may call me âspecial needsâ â we just think Iâm âspecialâ! Iâm 13 years old and have hypothyroidism which is being regulated through medication. I get eye drops 2 times a day, and when it comes to taking my medication, itâs easy-peasy for both me and my human (good boy)!

âKindness is a language that the deaf can hear and the blind can see.â

Miltonâs Ideal Forever Home

Is your heart full of kindness for a doggie like me? Iâll be able to feel your kindness every moment of every day from deep within my soul. And I will give you all of my heart. All I want is a human who will love me, protect me, and care for meâ¦ so I can live the rest of my life safely, in my own little world, with you by my side.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42720258/1/?bust=1537585688', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42720258/2/?bust=1537585692', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42720258/3/?bust=1537585695']",Milton ~ Small Wonder!,42720258,M,M,A

764,Baby,"Basenji, Labrador Retriever","Toby is an one-year-old Basenji, Labrador Retriever and Formosan Mountain Dog Mix from the country of Taiwan.  He currently weighs 51.4 pounds (as of 12/22/2018) and is fully grown.  Toby has arrived in US on 7/28/2018 and has been living with our foster family in North Wilmington in Delaware since then.   

Tobyâs rescued story:

Toby has a rough start; he was rescued from a litter of puppies after their mom died from being poisoned.  

In past January in Central Taiwan after several severe cold waves and freezing rain, a young girl discovered a dead dog body in her family fruit orchard.  The dogâs breasts were swollen and was clearly still nursing; she seemed being dead for several days.  A couple of feet away under bushes from the dead dog, the girl found eight under 2 weeks old unweaned puppies that were cold and wet and barely breathing.  She soon contacted a local animal rescue group that was willing to take the entire litter.

At the age of 10 weeks old, Toby and his siblings, six boys and two girls were all adopted; however, Toby was returned two months later because some of adoptive family members were allergic to dog hair.     

Tobyâs completed medical information:

Toby is a healthy puppy, and he has passed the following medical tests before coming to the US:  distemper test, 4 Idexx (Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma Phagocytophilum), CBC, Biochemistry blood work, and a PCR test for diseases and infections transmitted by fleas or ticks.  He also has x-rays on hips that are healthy, and he does not have hip dysplasia. 
 
Toby is neutered, de-wormed, up to date on all vaccinations including rabies shot.  He is heartworm negative and on preventative treatment and is micro chipped.  All Toby's medical documents including the x-rays films on his hips will be given to his adopter when he is adopted. 

Tobyâs temperaments and personality:

Toby has been living with foster family with over ten dogs of different sizes; he gets along very well with every one of them.  He loves to play with dogs and often initiates play.  In Taiwan before coming, Toby had lived with a foster family that has three cats for three months, Toby did not show interesting in cats and usually stayed away from them.  He is fine with cats, but they need to be dog-friendly.  

Toby has the temperament of a Labrador Retriever that loves people and is submissive.  He is also smart and a quick learner; he has learned most of basic English commends after living in the US for a short period of time.  

Toby is super sweet and passionate to his caregiver, he loves to cuddle and sleeps next to his foster mom on the bed; therefore, he is very attached to his foster mom here and follows her everywhere.  Whenever she is doing laundry or using the bathroom, Toby always follows her or stays outside the bathroom waiting for her to come out.  However, Toby is more independent in the yard, he LOVES to run with other dogs and likes to try different toys and carry them around, but always immediately shows up whenever his foster mom calls him from far away.  

Toby is a very happy puppy that brings a lot of light to his foster family.  He is a little shy to strangers at first but warms up quickly especially with treats; he LOVES food that can make him to relax faster.  He is not nervous in a new environment or surrounded by many people.  He rarely barks and never started any trouble if he knows he is not allowed.  

Toby is 100% house broken.  He likes to urinate on the grass, and whenever he needs to go out for potty, he would let his foster mom know by sitting by the door to the yard.  At nights, Toby has been sleeping in the foster momâs room along with other five medium-large dogs; Toby can hold his pee all night about 8-9 hours and 4-5 hours during the day.

Toby is not afraid of thunder or lighting and does not have separation anxiety either.  Even though Toby can be crated, we prefer that he is not kept in a cage by his new owner but being confined in an area with providing many durable toys.  

Toby has been living with dogs since being rescued, so we think that he will do much better with a family that has other non-alpha dog with similar size and temperament as Toby. 

Toby is not food or toys aggression or possession toward both people and dogs.  He likes children, but due to his size, age and sometimes he is still too rough while playing, he will not do well with children under 7 years old and retired senior people either.  Toby does not walk well on the leash; he is exciting to go out and often pulls the leash.

Toby loves car rides and does very well in the car; he will be a great companion for traveling, hiking or socializing with any events.  He loves to go out to meet different people and visit places.  He is very playful but not energetic; however, he is still a puppy that needs daily physical exercise and mental stimulation and should not be left at home alone for a long period of time every day. 

Toby will do better with the family that has a physical fence in the yard.  We do not prefer to place him into an apartment setting or a place being shared with roommates.

We hope that Tobyâs new family can include him in your daily activities to take him for outings, one-day trips or vacations except for taking him for neighborhood walks or playing in the backyard only; we really want Toby to have opportunities to experience different parts in his new life.   

How to meet Toby?

Toby has been living in the North Wilmington in Delaware for a month.  If you are seriously thinking of giving Toby a loving permanent home, please email us for an application.  Because we do not have a shelter to show people our dogs and all our rescues are living with our foster family, we do not accept stop-by visits if you are interested in seeing our dogs.  Before meeting Toby, the prospective adopter needs to fill out the application and gets approved.

773,Adult,German Shepherd Dog,"Penny (35lbs.) is a 7 year old, GSD mix that was rescued from a tiny chicken wire cage en route to the infamous Yulin dog meat festival. At the time of her rescue, it was apparent that Penny was in need of immediate medical attention to remove a maggot filled lymphoma from her body. Fortunately, her surgery went well and she made an unremarkable recovery. After months of waiting in China, Penny was finally cleared to travel to the US to search for a second chance at life.

Despite everything she's been through, Penny remains gentle and affectionate. She yearns for human affection and attention, making her the perfect family or companion dog. Penny has been well-socialized with other dogs and would likely do well in a home with respectful children.

776,Young,Border Collie,"Age: ~1.5 - 2 years old     
Weight: 45 lbs
Vet Record:  100% vaccinated, neutered, microchipped, male

Samy is a smart guy who would love to have his own place to run around and explore. He does not like being in a kennel and would really prefer to have more space of his own. Samy loves to walk on a leash and if you need some motivation to get out and exercise then Samy would love to be your handsome fitness partner. 

Samy is very affectionate, when you scratch his back, he will do his âSamy Danceâ where he hops around on his back legs and arches his back like a cat. This fun-loving, outgoing boy likes water and tries to catch it with his mouth if you spray him with the hose.

Volunteers Emily and Ann gave Samy a bath during their most recent visit and, while he didnât love it, he behaved very well and did not try to run away. 

Great with people as well as with dogs, Samy would be a perfect companion for someone with an active lifestyle â preferably someone who enjoys walking, playing and exploring new places on the weekend.

780,Adult,German Shepherd Dog,"Velvet And Callie Sisters Looking For A Home Together

Velvet and Callie are a pair of German Shepherd sisters rescued from a hoarder in New Jersey.  Today these friendly 4 year old sisters are ready to begin the best part of the rest of their lives; finding a loving home.  Velvetâs floppy ears give her a playful look, which perfectly matches her personality.  Velvet is inquisitive, friendly and is a happy go lucky girl.  Once she is comfortable with a new friend, she will come right up to you and give you a wet sloppy kiss.

Callie, her sister, is the more serious of the girls, and feels it is her place to look out for Velvet.  Although her demeanor is a bit more reserved than Velvet, Callie will warm up fairly quickly to new people and new surroundings.  Callie has the classic German Shepherd ears.  Like her sister she also likes to give a sweet kiss to her new friends.

Having lived most of their lives in crates and cramped conditions, Velvet and Callie just love now to go out and romp around a yard and play.  After a few minutes on a walk, they will settle down and walk fairly nicely, though a training lesson or two wouldnât hurt.  Velvet and Callie are moderate sized German Shepherds, around 60 pounds each.   They are in relatively good health, though both need to be spayed and Callie could use to put on a few pounds.  Otherwise they are up to date on all their vaccinations, and ready to go to their new home.

You can read about their story and the sad case of a lack of justice for the hoarder.  As of this time Sedona Shepherd has taken in four of the German Shepherds, including Wren and Kolby.   Since little money was recovered by the municipality, Sedona Shepherd (and all the rescues that have helped) have had to cover all of the medical costs for these dogs.  We estimate the veterinary care to cover all four of these beautiful dogs to be $2,500.  In addition to paying for all of their shots and check-up, Velvet and Callie need to be spayed.  Kolby needed surgeries for neutering and a hernia and is on medication to help manage his dry eye syndrome.  Please help us by donating to Velvet and Callieâs medical bills.

Sedona would also like to thank Terrie Carr and the Rock Nâ Ruff crew at WDHA for their feature of Velvet and Callie.

783,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"24 Nov 2018: Elijah is a sweet 2 year old who came into rescue after having been attacked by another dog through his kennel. This guy has made a full recovery and is ready for a foster or forever home. While in the past Elijah got along well with other dogs, given his experience he is currently showing some reactivity and so he would need decompression and very slow introductions. Elijah was in playgroups with other dogs at the shelter and showed himsellf to be a bit bossy. He would likely be ok with another submissive female, or would be just as happy to be your one and only, but is not a good candidate for the dog park. Elijah loves all humans and enjoys getting affection. He is a strong boy, who can pull on the leash. He is good with other dogs and kids, but should not be in a home with cats. Elijah has a sweet and silly personality and we cannot wait to see this goofball in a loving home. Please apply to foster or adopt.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42952226/1/?bust=1545216781', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42952226/2/?bust=1545217076', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42952226/3/?bust=1545217112']",Elijah,42952226,M,M,A

Booker is available for adoption. He is 8 years old and weighs 12 lbs. His adoption fee is $350.00. Meet Booker! This little guy was found wandering the streets of Philadelphia all by himself. After spending a few days at the animal control shelter, Save a Yorkie stepped in to help. Booker is approximately 8 years old and weighs 12 pounds. We don't know anything about his upbringing, but we do know he has a bright and sweet disposition in spite of the hardship he's endured. He is friendly and gently approaches adults, children and other dogs. He adapts to new people and environments very quickly. Booker enjoys playing with toys and going for walks, but most of all he loves lounging on the couch right next to his humans. He is very quiet and rarely barks. He walks nicely on a leash and knows how to sit. We are working on other commands. With the assistance of belly bands, he's learning to only mark his territory outside. Booker is neutered, microchipped and, thanks to his recent dental, has healthy and clean teeth! He had 8 teeth removed and is recovering from surgery like a champ. Booker is staying with Nancy in Brick, NJ.

She's great with other dogs and feels more comfortable as part of a ""pack"" so is looking for a calmer adult home with at least one other friendly dog to help her feel more secure.

Momma Dog Olga has done her job, she raised beautifully stunning babies, and saw them off to their respective homes; and now sheâs itching to find her own new story. 

Sweet Olga is young herself, around 2 years old, and would love to find a best friend to explore the world with. She definitely needs some manners on a leash, as her favorite to-do includes walking around in circles until youâre light-headed, or having you follow her horizontally and mid-air, but can you blame her? Sheâs on a mission! And thatâs to find her way into your heart. 

She gets along with other dogs, mostly minding her own business, but does love to tear up the yard with zoomies once in a while. Sheâs crate trained, although she does think itâs beneath her. 
Sheâs current on vaccines, spayed and healthy.

787,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Gorgeous Hallie is a one year old Pit mix who weighs 30 pounds. She comes into rescue from Texas. Hallie hasnât had the amazing life that every dog dreams of yet but now that she is safe with us we will make sure this girl finally has her fairy tale ending. She presented with some neurological symptoms. Hallie spent a few weeks at our San Antonio vet Partner and it was discovered that she was partially blind and deaf. She stumbled a lot and needed further diagnostic testing with a specialty hosp in NY. The specialist has determined that Hallie suffered from some type of trauma to the skull which is what is causing her issues. Sadly we think that she suffered this injury at the hands of humans or possibly suffered some type of brain infection that was never treated. Now we are dealing with her issues head on and she seems to be doing better. She has vision in one eye, and she stumbles less. She so wants to be a normal pup...running and playing with kids, cats, and dogs. Hallie is looking for that special someone who will care for her and her needs. Hallie is an absolutely beautiful girl who is very sweet and friendly. She will be spayed and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in her forever home.

female. 90 lbs. lots of energy! fenced in yard a must
This is Shana (or Shayna), our lovely LARGE still almost a puppy (approx a year old) who is just the most gorgeous thing! She weighs in at about 90lbs, we were told she is a lab mix.... but our instincts say mastiff mix- all those lovely wrinkles and goofy personality.

Shana is clumsy and growing into her body but does not understand how large she is, so we are thinking teen children and up.

She is pushy playing with dogs at Camp- she is so glad to be out, get to run, and be able to play that she overwhelms them a bit-again her goofiness and her size. Our instincts say that if there is another dog in the house, that dog needs to be tolerant of a big, goofy, high energy puppy-like doofus.

Fenced in yard is a must for this pup.

From Maria's Corner in September newsletter:

Shayna has been in at least 2 shelters, 1-2 rescues and who knows how many homes. It's time we find her the real deal.
She needs an adopter who will give her time to settle in.There's no set rule of ""2 weeks"" or ""10 days,"" to adapt. It could take her much longer. I remember knowing a case where it took the dog a year to relax. They had an amazing adopter for sure!!! From my own personal experience, I once had a dog that took about 6 months to settle in. There's just no telling. Every dog is truly individual.

Handsome Jake is a wonderful family companion. During the day he likes to roam around the yard and chase squirrels and chipmunks; he likes to go on walks or tag along on car rides. At night, Jake loves nothing more than laying on his back and having his belly rubbed. If you could pet him 24/7, Jake would sit there and soak it up the entire time. He loves attention!!

Jake does have a tendency to be overprotective in his home. While he is amazing with the immediate family, he doesn't always love when visitors come by. Sometimes it's best to put him in a room when others are over and shut the door. He doesn't scratch or bark once he's put away.

Outside the home, he is usually well behaved. He has stayed for multiple days at the Pet Spa and has gotten great reviews for behavior.

Jake lived in a house with another dog and there have never been any issues. In addition to our own children, we had a few young relatives stay with us for a few weeks at a time (ages 3 & 2) and he was great with them (although we watched him closely).

Jake has been cat tested & seems to be okay with feline friends. He is up to date on vaccines, neutered, and microchipped.

She's one smart, well-trained pup!

Velvet soft fur and an equally soft heart... that's Natasha. This 4 year old young girl came in pregnant and heartworm positive. Her puppy found a home, her heartworm is all gone, and she's ready to find her forever home and live happily ever after. Natasha recently passed her Canine Life and Social Skills test, showing off what a smart, well-trained girl she is. Learn all about her in the video above, and e-mail shelter@spca914.org or call (914) 941-2896 x11 with any questions.

When to Come:
Unless noted differently above, our hours are Monday-Saturday 10am-4pm and Sunday 1pm-4pm. Our adoptions are first come, first served based on the status of your application. 

What to Bring:
Please bring a copy of your current pet(s)â vaccination records (if you currently have a dog or cat or did within the last 2 years) and a copy of your lease (if you rent or own a condo/co-op/townhouse) in case we are unable to get hold of your veterinarian or landlord/management company on the day you come in.

We do same day adoptions pending application approval/satisfactory reference checks, except in the case of dogs listed as Trainer Adoptions (on occasion, some Trainer Adoption dogs are able to go home same day). With all adoptions, every person living in the home where the dog will reside must come meet the dog, and any dogs already in the home must come for a meet and greet as well.

We do NOT hold animals, nor do we accept deposits in advance. If you have discussed coming in to meet an animal or have an approved application, this does not guarantee that you will get a particular puppy or dog. If you do not bring your dog(s) or all residents of your home to meet the dog, we cannot hold that dog for you.

813,Adult,Mixed Breed,"Meet King. King is a big baby who just wants to love and be loved. In August of 2016, at just 3 years old, King was abandoned by his family.  Dropped at a high kill shelter, where owner surrenders can be immediately euthanized. We couldnât let that happen to this sweet young boy.  We saw his picture, this big dopey boy snuggled up at the shelter with a smaller pittie girl and we just had to save them both (see Pennyâs story too!) 
King was unsure of his new surroundings and a little nervous when he got to his foster home.  So many new sights and sounds and smells and where was his family?  Understandably, he was confused and had a tough time settling in. We donât know much about his history but we donât think Kingâs previous âfamilyâ was very nice to him.  He came to us with some quirks that led us to believe he was probably not treated very well, possibly even abused. 
King didnât really like to be crated, he wasnât great at sharing his toys, although he likes other dogs, and he was always nervous someone was going to take his food away.  As time went on and his foster mom worked with him, he came to like his crate, although he still would prefer you not stick your fingers in there and he doesnât like to be crated if he can hear that peope are home. He wants to come out and play! And he will make his typical pittie whining sounds that donât even sound like a dog. King has gotten much better at sharing toys, although he does sometimes need to be reminded to share nicely when he gets a brand new toy. What younginâ doesnât right?  King is learning, and getting better every day, at understanding that he doesnât need to worry about anything but being a dog anymore. He will sometimes still flinch when someone raises their voice or moves quickly or raises things above his head, but he is learning that nobody will hurt him anymore. 
This silly, funny, loving boy loves to play and run and be with his people.  At bedtime he happily curls up next to his foster mom and snuggles in for the night. Heâs a big snugglebug. Sometimes he forgets that heâs 100 lbs and tries to jump into your lap for some love.  He has no idea how big and powerful he really is. He walks beautifully on a leash and is not fazed by passing cars, people, or other dogs. He loves to play fetch, have his ears scratched, and play with anyone who is willing.
King is still working on building his confidence.  In the meantime, he can occasionaly (very infrequently) be nervous around new people. However, a proper intro by his foster mom quickly quells his nerves and heâs all lovebug. Heâs simply still learning that he doesnât need to be afraid anymore, that that part of his life is over. Once he sees someone he knows, King canât wait to greet them with love and kisses and hugs.  He is still learning not to jump to greet people, he just gets so excited to see his friends! He really just loves to be loved on. 
King would do best in a home with an experienced large dog owner who can play with him regularly.  He is still young and unaware of his size and still working to forget his past so a home without small children would be best. He does like other dogs but has not been around cats, but we think he would do fine with a cat given proper introduction .  His current foster home has rabbits that King regularly play bows to and canât figure out why his foster mom wonât let him play with.  (Itâs because he doesnât realize how big he is and could accidentally hurt them, but he doesnât understand that).

And why wouldnât we ! Heâs a sweet gentle 8 year old dog who was surrendered to the shelter because of âallergies â. Now we wondered about that however perhaps the people were not his original owners. Perhaps they took him in and couldnât keep him.  
Heâs a little guy around 40 lbs. and easy to walk and handle.  
We never say a dog is house trained but we can surely say thereâs an excellent chance with Loso. 
Loso is fine around other dogs and basically ignores them. Heâs only been here two weeks and seems to be adjusting to the Yonkers Animal Shelter as well as can be expected. 
Heâs a very pretty shade off light brown, almost a dark tan.  He just likes a little affection and companionship.  
Loso is a low maintenance dog who will make a wonderful companion for someone.

Damon is a special dog who came from South Carolina to make room for Florence dogs.  He is a sweet large 65 pound dog with a fused rear leg.  We had our vet check it out.  He said he thinks that maybe as a young puppy Damon had a broken leg set for too long a time and his muscles and soft tissue atrophied so his leg is fused.  He did not recommend amputating it as Damon does use it for some support, and if removed, it might put too much strain on the other leg leading to more health issues.  If you want to rescue a super sweet special needs dog, Damon would be perfect.

BARBIE'S STORY:
I sit and wait...... Life was never that easy for me, my people didn't seem to really want me around. They never took the time to take me to the vet or get me spayed so still being a pup myself I found myself caring for my own babies....and then it got worse. We ended up at a shelter)o; Thank goodness for some really nice, caring people who helped us to safety right away! I did the very best I could and all three pups are doing great!! They even found homes of their own! Now it's MY turn, I'm small.... only about 40lbs and really just want time to run and play and be a pup myself. I heard the vet say I was about 2 yrs old and that I will be getting spayed soon so I don't have to have any more babies. I have been vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped as well. All set for my forever family, so now it's time!! My temporary foster mom says I'm a sweetheart and anyone would be lucky to have me in their life. I am house broken and crate trained.

835,Senior,Bichon Frise,"Sparky is a super sweet older gentleman (approx 12-14) who was surrendered to rescue when his owner no longer could take care of him.  He would make a great companion as he loves attention!  

Sparky's foster says that he loves to snuggle on soft things . . . be it a dog bed, a stuffed animal or an item of clothing found on the floor.  He would prefer a quieter home to spend his golden years.  Sparky is good with other dogs, kids, cats and even goats and chickens!  He is housebroken and stays right by you outside, and then walks back to you when he is ready to go in. Being an older gentleman, he does need to go out a bit more than the younger guys, but goes right to the door to let you know. He is pretty quiet, and has the cutest waddle you ever did see!

Sparky was checked out by the vet and other than a heart murmur and a benign cyst, the doctor gave him a clean bill of health :-) He just needs a retirement home where he can be loved and spoiled.

He loves to bond with special humans and would do best in a medium active home. His foster mom has only had him 24 hours and says: ""Oso has kind eyes that draw you in for a wet nose kiss! He is super quiet and enjoys being perched up on the window sill to people watch and get familiar with the New York sounds. When heâs not on watch, heâs curled by your side â still alert, half asleep just in case thereâs a new sound he hasnât heard before and he doesnât want to miss it! Heâs still getting the hang of dog toys and the comfort of a dog bed but a soft blanket on the couch will do the trick. He is great on a leash, will either trail by your feet or eagerly strut in front when itâs not crowded. Oso loves to meet new people, he is comfortable with men and women, heâll take all of the rubs he can get. He seems housebroken with only a few accidents so far, and he mostly holds it until we get outside."" Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org!

837,Young,Great Pyrenees,"NYS Registered Rescue # RR102
NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

This girlâs name is Spirit and she has a lot of it. She is young at around one year old, and loves to play. She is all about a âspiritedâ game of tug-of-war and will even play fetch and bring it back...most of the time :) If there is no one available to play with her, she will toss the toys around herself and pounce on them. The âPuppy Spiritâ is strong in this one. And if you havenât figured it out yet, she loves toys! A full toy box is a must for this girl; and a person who doesnât mind toys scattered around. Spirit is a firm believer that toys are meant to be played with and she will get them all out to amuse herself during a play session. But donât get the idea that this girl stays âspiritedâ all of the time. Oh, no. She has her moments of play and will tuck her butt and get the zoomies outside like all puppies but she has the typical energy of any one- year old Pyr. Spirit loves to snuggle and will bury her head in a personâs lap while being petted. If a person sits on the floor, she will immediately move in for a hug. If a person lays on the floor she will lay on top for more snuggles. But donât worry, she wonât squish anyone. Spirit is a Pyr on the smaller side at 75-80 lbs. This girl is smart and loves to please her people. She is treat-motivated, already knows âsitâ and is housetrained. The command âcomeâ is more challenging like it is with a lot of Pyrs but she doesnât like to be outside by herself so when everyone else goes in, she is at the door wanting to come inside also. Spirit is great with other dogs but not with cats. She has always lived in an urban setting and has no problem doing her business on a leash so will be fine in a leash only home as long as there is a place she can run and play with other dogs (a four-foot fence is enough to hold her). She is a beautiful little girl with a playful, sweet and loving âspiritâ!",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43042608/1/?bust=1541707234'],Spirit,43042608,F,L,A

Dewey would be perfect for a quiet, low traffic home without much company, as he can be territorial and owner-protective with strangers. From his foster, he is sweet and affectionate, perfectly house-mannered, walks nicely on the leash, knows basic obedience commands, and rides well in the car. He also was friendly with other dogs in foster and used to attend doggie daycare, so he should be able to live with a doggie sibling after meeting to make sure it's a good match.

PEBBLES TRAGIC DEATH  10/14/18:

We are devastated and grieving over the tragic death of our dog Pebbles, who had been placed in boarding at  Northwind Kennels, in Bedford, NY.  

Pebbles, a senior Cocker, had been boarding along with her senior Pit Bull sister CInnabon since mid-summer while we tried to find this deeply bonded pair a home together. On Saturday, October 13th, Pebbles was viciously attacked and mortally wounded by another Pit Bull by the name of Wanda (owned by a private client of Northwind Kennels). We are unclear how this horrendous tragedy happened. Initially, we were told by the facilityâs owner that Wanda climbed over a 6 foot chain link fence dividing two adjoining play areas. The next day, she told us that Wanda had managed to shimmy her way under a defective fence. As the dogs had been left unattended, there are no witnesses to Pebblesâ attack. We were told by the owner she has working cameras throughout her facility, but has refused to provide us with video of the incident.

We were told by the volunteer worker who left the dogs unattended that she returned to the play area to witness Cinnabon fighting with Wanda some ten feet away from the spot where Pebbles was lying bleeding and severely injured. We believe Cinnabon was attempting to ward Wanda off and to save her beloved Cocker sister, but to no avail. Northwind staff brought Pebbles to an emergency clinic but failed to notify us of the attack for almost 5 hours, which we consider inexcusable. Pebbles had undergone  emergency surgery in the early hours of the morning on 10/14, but her condition continued to worsen. In the hopes of saving her life, we transferred her by ambulance to the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan later that day, where she died shortly after arrival. The AMC informs us that she suffered a spinal injury in the attack and that she had also developed sepsis. In our rescueâs 15 year history, this incident is one of the most devastating things to happen to one of our dogs. 

We ask you to pray for Cinnabon, who witnessed the attack on her best friend, and now is deeply grieving in her temporary foster home.  RIP our poor sweet Pebbles. You did not deserve this fate.  Forever in Cinnabonâs and our hearts... ???


GETTING OLD CAN BE THE PITS! BONDED SENIORS DUMPED IN SHELTER, URGENT HELP IS NEEDED!

Dogs are INDIVIDUALS, they should not be placed in pigeon holes just because of their breed. We have recently learned about two seniors dumped in the Manhattan Shelter, a female Cocker and her lifetime companion, who happens to be a Pit. Pebbles is the Cocker, Cinnabon is the Pit Bull, both are wonderful dogs. Both girls will shortly be coming our way, so we are in urgent need of a foster home where they can be placed together. Both scored high on their temperament tests when evaluated at the shelter, so there is no need to be frightened of Cinnabon just because of her breed. These girls cannot be separated, as they are a bonded pair. Pebbles and Cinnabon will fully vetted prior to being placed (to include full bloodwork, spay, dental, they will get the works). Both have been fully vaccinated at the shelter and are also heartworm negative. Senior medical is always costly, so donations are urgently needed. Donations can be made via our website at www.nyabandonedangels.com/donate. 

Please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com if you are able to foster or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com to submit an application. Life should not end up being the pits just because oneâs a senior, nor should two dogs be pulled apart just because of breed. Please help these dogs remain together, they are true soul sisters!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42122402/1/?bust=1531029475', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42122402/2/?bust=1540518317']",Cinnabon,42122402,F,M,A
846,Adult,Parson Russell Terrier,"Sobe (pronounced Sobie) is a precious little girl who loves nothing more than attention from her people, or any person really. When you speak to her, she looks right into your eyes, that little tail starts to wag and in seconds her entire body is wiggling and jiggling over to you. She is a total lovebug.

Sobe enjoys playing with toys and sunbathing. She loves to be petted, groomed, brushed and cuddled but if youâre too busy sheâs happy just to keep you company and watch what youâre doing. She walks beautifully on leash and is housetrained, too.

Sobe would be happiest in a home where she is not left home alone for long periods of time. This little sweetheart can be mischievous and will test the boundaries from time to time. She requires a yard with a fence no less than 4 feet high and proper introductions with other dogs.

Sobe gets along with people of all shapes, sizes and ages! And LOVES CHILDREN! Sheâs a very friendly pup who loves to give kisses.

Meet the beautiful Momma Maize, a Shepherd mix born in late 2015, and her little boy Onyx, who is growing up! Maize and Onyx are a bonded pair who need to stay together.

Both are good with people and other dogs.

Whoever adopts this precious pair will have hit the jackpot twice!

Foster mom says:

""Maize is amazingly sweet, loves to be next to you relaxing and loves getting brushed. She is not a fan of small animals, and would do best in a home with a fenced yard and on lead because she does jump a 5 foot fence with no problem!
Onyx is just a huge goofball! He LOVES to chase a ball and wrestle with Mom.""

They are both crate trained, altered and up to date on vaccines.

Foster mom makes their wet food each week and adds dry dog food named Wholehearted. ""I make rice, peas, carrots, apples, pineapple with turkey and beef. I give a heaping cupful with a cup of dry in the morning and a cup of dry only in evening. I feed them in their crates because Maize will

let Onyx eat her food! She still treats him like a puppy!""

I'm easy that way. This is my first week in New York City, but what a PLACE! There are so many smells here, and on my walks I am determined to sniff them ALL out. I notice everything in the neighborhood -- the sounds, the people, the other dogs -- but I'm pretty chill about it all; I just take it all in, no need for fussing or barking. I think fall might be my favorite season, because one of my favorite things to do when I'm outside is to run through leaves. I love people, including both kids and adults, and I love to make them happy. (Oh, and I'm house-trained already which really made my foster family happy!) I just know I'm going to find my forever family very soon and we will all have lots of fun and lots of snuggle time together!

Jackson would be the most wonderful addition to any home without children and with people who take charge! You see, Mr. Browne can sometimes be over protective of his family, especially children. He guards the house and his people that he loves so he needs some direction and a strong leader. That being said, he has a personality unlike any other pup. He's sweet, playful, silly, loving, and knows when to RELAX!! He's a great cuddler and will curl up next to you, even in the smallest of spaces. He loves his belly rubs, so be prepared when he stretches out his paws to you!

Jackson also loves to go on walks and adventures and ESPECIALLY loves the water!! He pulls slightly on the leash, but he is great in the car. Once Jackson meets you, he LOVES you, but it does take time. He is generally good with meeting dogs and people outside on the leash, but sometimes he gets nervous so make sure to properly introduce him first! Again, Jackson is friendly with most dogs, but can be dog selective.

Jackson is housetrained, knows basic commands, and listens very well. Jackson can be trained easily. He is the most lovable, most precious dog and he will love you completely.

Moses is a friendly, happy boy who loves to play & even knows a few commands like Sit, Go to Bed and Paw. He enjoys going for walks & is fine on a leash and in a crate. And if you're going for a car ride, Moses would be happy to keep you company in the car.

875,Young,Border Collie,"Recently we started working with a rescue in Turkey. Like in most Middle East Countries, these dogs have little to NO chance of being adopted as they are not ""purebred"". There are little to no shelters and governemnt funding for animal welfare is rare. These animals need us and we would never turn our back on an animal in need. 

Meet Terra~ 

Terra's story from his Rescuer: His video was first seen on social media, which showed him living chained to what was basically a poultry house. He didnât even have a proper shelter and the people who saw him said that he was constantly being kept tied up, and was not fed for days at times. I talked to the man who took his videos and he talked to the âownerâ of the dog and explained that the dog was going to die there if they insisted on keeping him. The âownerâ let us rescue him, he spent 2 weeks at the vet, during which he was neutered and given vitamins/supplements as he had a mild cold and was very skinny. Heâs been at the dog hotel ever since and we now know that he is a very well behaved and a very very smart dog, he gets along really good with other dogs and is overall a very easygoing guy. Considering he is not a special breed nor a small dog, he hasnât had any luck finding a home and Iâm sure he would adjust really well to any family that might adopt him. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terra is 2-years old, up to date on shots, neutered, great with dogs and all people (cats unknown). He has no food or toy aggression and has experience walking on a leash. He is an all around very sweet, low energy, 40lb Collie mix who would do amazing with any family and in any setting. This boy deserves a home and will reward anyone who gives it to him! 

Terra will be arriving on December 25th eager to find her very own loving forever family. Apply now for sweet as pie Terra and get ready for unending love and affection!

901,Adult,Pug,"Recsue costs are extreme. We appreciate any help for the pugs in rescue! An online Petco gift card is appreciate! It's very difficult to find special needs pugs a forever home. Rambo is Pug Planet's mascot. He has become a resident pug who has been with us since a puppy. We make a commitment to pugs like Rambo who are unable to find forever homes that can care for special needs pugs.  Your support helps us care and take in more pugs that need our help. ~~~Pug Planet's mascot RAMBO is 9 yrs old as of Sept 2016. !!!!!Â   Sept 2015 Rambo had his dental and some teeth removed. Rambo was abandoned as a pup along w/ a sister who we did find a forever home for.  they were found at approx. 8 weeks young on the streets of Philadelphia in a box. This little guy has been through so much! He has front arm deformities and no real elbow joints. He cannot get around like a normal dog and cannot do steps. He needs to be carried.  Rambo has a long story we hope you'll read about his courage, strength perseverance and love!! Rambo wasn't named Rambo for nothing! Check out Pug Planet's Face Book page to see Rambo's BDay Photo!~~~~~~~Update/July 29, 2014 In addition to having  a thyroid issue to deal with. He also developed a staph infection on his neck we are treating. He does seem better now on the thyroid meds!

June 29, 2014 Not acting like his normal ""perky"" self.  Rambo tested w/ very low thyroid. A few weeks on thyroid meds 2x a day and more blood work after several weeks to see if his current med will help Rambo gain back his energy!~~~~~~~3/15/12 Rambo's stitches are out and therapy begins! 3/1/12 Rambo was happy to be home on Tuesday night. He cried several times through the evening. On Wed. he made it through w/o any cries. He cannot have any activity except for bathroom breaks for the next 2 weeks. During these 2 weeks he will receive a strong antibiotic and 2 pain meds that also help w/ inflammation. Inflammatory med will continue for the next month. Ice packs 3x a day will also be applied given he tolerates it. Like the other knee he had surgery on in October this one also has pins. The stitches come out in two weeks and therapy begins for the next 6 weeks. Part of his therapy we will gradually try to get him to walk 1-3x per day. He cannot play, run or jump and no stairs though his abilities are limited due to his elbow luxations anyway. Play time will be hard to avoid and his other pug buddies certainly don't understand. It''s hard for everyone but obviously we all want what's best for Rambo! In his 3 years of being with us since he was abandoned in the streets of Philadelphia he has amazed us with his strength, courage and unconditional love. Every one that meets him is amazed how happy he is, good spirited and has no idea that he is different from the other pugs. Rambo always has a smile on his face and kisses to give to all that meet him!~~~~~ UPDATE: RAMBO HAS HIS 2nd of TWO KNEE SURGERIES SCHEDULED FOR MONDAY, FEB. 27th!! Pretty soon he will be able to stand up on both back feet again! **Any help for Rambo is appreciated** He did so well having his first knee done in October continue reading......... Oct 10th-Rambo had one of 2 knee surgeries. He stayed overnight in the hospital and is home now. He had pins put in his knee. Stitches will come out in 10-14 days. Then he starts therapy. 2 Pain meds 3x a day & an antibiotic .In a few months he will have the same knee surgery on his other knee. Long road for him but he's Rambo! We appreciate any help for Rambo! When Rambo saw the orthopedist it was not his hip as was originally thought. Although it does have arthritis it is not what is causing Rambo problems and he is in no pain from it. The problem is his knees!! Yes both knees! The right is worse then the left. The are called ""trick knees"" or luxating patellas. Both his knees pop in and out but the right does not pop back in like the left does. So the plan will be to start with Rambo's right knee to surgically correct it. He will have a long recovery. Surgery involves deepening the knee cap groove and realigning the knee cap with the groove. Typical recovery time (for dogs walking normally on the front legs) is approximately 2-3 months. It might take Rambo a little longer given his front leg issues. Any help for poor Rambo is greatly appreciated! Stay tuned for updates. UPDATE 8/11: Rambo had been having trouble with his left rear leg and first thing we thought was Legg Perthes. He had the surgery on his left side and is fully recovered from that. So we had some X rays done and it showed bad arthritis in his left hip joint. Dr. recc. Rimadyl for now and to see how he does. Eventually he will need surgery on the left hip to clean out the joint. If anyone would like to help sponsor him Rambo can certainly use some ""Pug Angels""!! -------------------------1/19/11 just had his annual vet visit and vaccinated. Dr. says he looks great! ~~~~~~ Rambo is an amazing little guy so happy and playful. He loves people and other pugs. He is just a little over 2 yrs of age now and has been in our foster care since he was just a little abandoned pug puppy. You can read on for Rambo's story.~ You should see him get around despite his front arm deformities. He acts just like a normal pug and is in no pain at all. He gets around well especially when its time to eat or get a treat! Rambo just needs a family to love him and to accept him the way he was born. He is also a very good boy when it comes to going outside to do his business!*****UPDATE 6/12/09 I just had my First B day! I am still looking for my forever home. If you meet me you will see Iam a happy boy yes I have had some setbacks in my life but I have 110% pug love to offer. If you have a warm lap please adopt me!******* 8/28/09-Hi there-I am still looking for my forever home. If you give me a chance I can show you how much love I can give and you will overlook my disability. I can kiss, play and romp around just like any other dog although they may outrun me! My friends at Pug Planet tell me I'm such a good boy and a special family will come along. I'm waiting to meet you!! 4/1/09 Hello everyone! Iam getting around much better now. You should see how fast I can boogie around by myself! My hip continues to get stronger w/ every passing day. Thanks for keeping me in your prayers. I am still looking for a forever home. I am very good in the housebreaking dept if I go outside I do my business. If you put wee wee pads down I will use them as well. I guarentee if you meet me you'll realize I'm a super pug!~~~~~2/28/09 RAMBO IS HOME FROM HIP SURGERY! We just got the little guy back from the hospital last night. He did great and was so happy to see us! These first 2 weeks are restricted to just doing his ""business"" outside. The following 4-6 weeks w/ be physical therapy. Staples will come out in 10-14 days. He is on 3 meds right now antibiotics and 2 for pain mgmt. He ate dinner when he came home = typical pug appetite! :) We'll be posting Rambo's progess through the next 6 weeks. ***********************2/26/09 Rambo saw the orthopedist this morning and it is confirmed he does have Leg Perthes Disease. The blood supply is compromised and there is a fracture as a result of this genetic disease. The orthopedist took him right into surgery this morning. He will need to create a hip joint for Rambo as well as fix the blood supply and remove any diseased tissue. More bad news is Rambo's other side has hip dysplasia. Do to his obvious challenges of his front legs this would be a separate surgery for Rambo. The surgeon wants to see how he does after a month of the first surgery. So yet another long road ahead of us in rehab & physical therapy. Rambo had done so well w/ learning to walk on his hind legs I wish you could have all saw the strides he made. This is the 2nd case of Leg Perthes Disease we have had in rescue. Last year it was a puppy named Romeo and he is doing amazingly well. PLEASE KEEP RAMBO IN YOUR PRAYERS we appreciate any help towards his medical needs and will continue to update everyone on Rambo!******************************************** VIDEO FOOTAGE OF RAMBO & his sister SCARLETT. Copy & paste the code into your browser. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkpY1huD2oI ~~~~~~~~FEB. 13~~~~~~Poor Rambo ........After he had been neutered and the cone removed he was not using his rear legs like he was used to. He was really getting the hang of walking on his rear legs and stood on them a lot. Everyone who saw his progress was amazed. After several weeks and not much improvement we made an appointment to see what was up. Unfortunately this little guy can't seem to catch a break ! X Rays showed that one side of his hip joint is not in socket. This did not result from any fall or injury. Dr said it is genetic and may be once again as with Romeo the pug puppy Leg Perthes Disease. Once we meet with the orthopedic specialist we will know for sure, but it will definitely require surgery and a lot of rehab to get him walking and to use a doggie cart as well. Despite another major setback he is not in any obvious pain. Rambo is strong willed, happy and loves everyone. We appreciate any support for little Rambo~~~~~~~~ ~~~~ Rambo was neutered 10 days ago. He is now 11 Lbs of puppy love. We had 2 emergency's where the incision opened up on him. The 2nd time we brought him to the emerg. vet he was sedated and they stitched him up. Just finished w/ antibiotics and they the stitches should come out in a few more days. Good News his elbow swelling has gone down considerably! He is getting around amazingly and learning to walk on his rear legs more and more w/ each passing day! He's such a great little guy and has no idea he is ""different"" from the others. New picts coming soon!!!~~~~ 10-25 -We have been having trouble w/ one of Rambos elbows and fluid accumulation since the last orthopedic visit/exam. Unfortunately he is not a candidate for surgery. If the elbow continues to build up fluid he will need a drain placed in it and hope that any infection does not occur. He gets around fine and is not in any pain thankfully. We appreciate any help for little Rambo. He had his final set of puppy shots last week and will be neutered next month. 10/4-We really appreciate those adopters of Pug Planet and pug pals (some even from other states!) that have joined in to help these little babies THANK YOU for your support!! We had a pug event last week many got the oppt. to meet these precious little pups and saw how happy and beautiful they are :)Next week we are going to see another orthopedist. We have also consulted w/ a trainer that specializes in disabled pets. (video coming soon!) Scarlet & Rambo had their 2nd set of puppy shots the other day and they have grown. Rambo a bit over 2 Lbs. now 8 Lbs. and Scarlet almost 2 more Lbs. now at a little over 6 Lbs.~~~~~~~~~~~~ 9/19/08 UPDATE Scarlet & her brother Rambo went to the orthopedist. Here is what we learned. Their deformity doesn't really have a name . Essentially what's going on is that their elbows (2 in each) are dislocated and cannot physically be put back in proper place due to muscle contracture and fibrosis - which came first, the dislocation or the muscle contracture is impossible to tell. Unfortunately, the deformity cannot be corrected surgically. Although we were not prepared to hear that we are looking into getting carts for the pups so they can scoot about. We may need a few carts due to them only being 12 weeks of age and 6 Lbs. each. If anyone has a cart they would like to donat for the front limbs or can provide a loaner please contact us! We appreciate any help for both Scarlet and her brother Rambo.~~~~~Isn't he adorable! Rambo and his sister Scarlet were found abandoned in a box to fend for themselves. Although Rambo & Scarlet appear to look like normal pugs but BOTH pups have a serious deformity on their front legs. Definitely a genetic flaw. This leaves the pups unable to walk on their paws so instead they are crawling on their forearms w/ their butts high in the air to get around. However they are not in any apparent pain. They have learned to get around pretty quick. They wag their tail and love to play. I think we can all gather that the person who had most likely abandoned the pups was a backyard breeder. ~~We will update as we learn more they will be seeing an orthopedist soon.~~***We can only accept applications at this time once the pups have their surgery and physical therapy they can be placed in forever homes.***** ~~We really need PUG ANGELS!!!~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *****PLEASE note we will accept and review applications until we feel a suitable match is found and is not a first come first serve basis.****Sorry but we cannot answer any emails w/ questions about the pugs. All info is on each pugs bio page. Please read our main page on our adoption policy and for any add't information you may need.**** ########################################## We appreciate any much needed items on our wish list!!!!!

902,Young,"Shepherd, Boxer","When Celeste was found as a stray and turned into a Texas shelter, she was so scared that she would just tremble in place. She wouldnât even walk on leash and had to be carried into the shelter. Needless to say she did not show well and as a result, due to overcrowding, was scheduled to be put down. We were lucky enough to find a foster to take Celeste into her home and show her that the world is not always a bad place.

Celeste made the trip from Texas to New Jersey and is currently in a multi dog household. It took her a few days to adjust, and once again conquer her fears, and now she is a silly happy girl seeking her forever home.

Similar to her shelter days, Celeste does not show well when meeting new people. Her first instinct is to cower and hide. It will take her time to open up and show her true self. What a gift it was the first time we saw her smile, the first time she came running up to us wagging her tail, the first time she played in the yard with our dogs , the first time she grabbed a bone and started chewing it. You, too, can share in those experiences if you are patient and give her the time she needs to trust.

We do not know what happened to Celeste in the past, but we do know her future is bright! She would love to find a home with a fenced in yard as well as another confident dog to show her the ropes.

Celeste is playful and has the most expressive eyes. She has just the right amount of energy and has some silly antics too! She is house trained and crate trained and as fearful as she is, she does enjoy going for walks!

if you would like to meet at Celeste, please submit an application and be sure to mention her name, CELESTE TEXAS.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42832043/1/?bust=1544811258', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42832043/2/?bust=1544811260', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42832043/3/?bust=1544811262']",Celeste Texas,42832043,F,M,A
903,Young,"Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier","** COURTESY POST* 

Marla is a 1.5 year old pit mix looking for her forever home. She is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. Her foster saved her from a bad situation. When she was picked up, she had just been attacked by other dogs she was living with, had large gaping wounds and it looked like she might have had puppies recently. The vet said Marla had visible scars and this wasn't the first time she had been attacked and it was possible she had just had puppies. As sad as Marla's past is, she doesn't let it get her down!  Marla is housebroken, crate trained, sweet and absolutely loves snuggling. She is great with other dogs (she is currently living with another dog in her foster home). It is unknown how she would do with cats as her foster family doesn't have any. Marla does get a bit excited when first meeting new people and will jump, but her foster family is working on that with positive reinforcement training. Because she's a bit jumpy it would be best if she went with older kids ages 10 yrs+.  She has come such a long way since she has been living in her foster home and would do best with a  family that is active and will continue the training started by her foster family. Ideally, her forever home would have a fenced in backyard for her to run around in. Marla is one sweet bunny of a dog and will be your BFF!! Come meet/adopt her today!!

We had originally rescued him from the shelter, he was brought in as a stray and was friendly but then got very scared the longer he stayed in the shelter.  Bentley was adopted out about a year ago but the adopter sadly lost her home and had no where to go with her 2 dogs.  Bentley is very bonded with his housemate CJ who is a mini Dachshund and they MUST be adopted together. Bentley is a sweet boy but is nervous around new people at first, he does warm up quickly.  However, Bentley and CJ are emotional support for one another.  Since he is shy he should probably only go to a home with older kids.  To adopt Bentley is $250.00 which includes his neuter, shots, heartworm test and microchip.

909,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Blind Dog Rescue Alliance will set up a transport within reasonable distance. Sweet Piper is  being fostered in western PA.

What we know about Piper:
*blind from cataracts
*calm girl
*affectionate
* could be good around older children
*good around other dogs

This is what Piper's foster mom has to say about Piper:
Piper is an older lady who was found wandering down a busy road with a blind cohort.  Fortunately, a good samaritan picked them up and took them to a shelter.  Piper's doggy friend was adopted and Piper went into a foster home with Blind Dog Rescue Alliance. 
Piper loves human attention, naps and meal time.  She can be a bit pushy with her foster siblings but, at her age, that's ok, especially since she's only grumpy when she can smell food and she wants it all to herself. 
Piper is currently waiting for her forever home so she doesn't have to share her mommy with so many other siblings.  She loves men and women.  She has not been around children.  She is indifferent around cats and other dogs long as they stay out of her space. 
Piper is excited to see what goodies Santa will bring her!
Blind Dog Rescue Alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40925250/1/?bust=1518371931', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40925250/2/?bust=1518371939', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40925250/3/?bust=1518371945', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40925250/4/?bust=1518371951', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40925250/5/?bust=1544743055']",Piper; Sweet girl (PA),40925250,F,M,A

He is a lab mix who was picked up by a kind person who told us they had to use bolt cutters to get the chain off. He is about 2.5 years old now. Forrest can be affectionate, and enjoys spending time on the walks with volunteers. He loves treats but has known to be too excited. He hass some trust issues but can you blame him as his past history was probably not a pleasant one. Forrest would definitely benefit from some training. He must be the only child but will complete your family. Would not recommend him for a home with children, cats or dogs.

Shortly after he arrived, our volunteers noticed that he was having trouble focusing on things. He was immediately taken to the vet, and we discovered that Duke had developed juvenile cataracts. Currently he is being treated with drops, and he is scheduled to have eye surgery in August to have his vision restored. Duke is a typical husky and his temporary vision limitation has not slowed him down. He is full of energy and very playful with other dogs. He enjoys long walks and walks nicely on a leash. He can be a little mouthy at times, but takes corrections well and we believe that once he can see, he will stop trying to âseeâ with his mouth.

URGENT FOSTER NEEDED ... BONDED, BROKEN AND FINALLY HOMELESS! OUR STORY OF âBENDLESS LOVEâ!

Eight days til Christmas and we have no place to go... no presents under the Christmas tree and no family to love and spoil us ? Right now we only have each other and a Christmas wish to hold onto.

Our names are Bender and Flexo. We are recent pre-holiday dumps at Brooklyn Animal Care and Control. We are 3 and 4 years old, respectively, and have not been well cared for during our lives. We are dirty with very infected ears, but are shortly being groomed and vetted so that we can go home. We are dogs with great temperaments and still have faith in people. We are both convinced that we got a raw deal and are deserving of much better. We are both neutered, microchipped, current on all shots, and also heartworm negative. Can you take us in? Two dogs are always better than one and what a start to the New Year! To take us home, please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com, where you can complete and return an application online. We are ready for âfuturamaâ and for the good times to begin. WOOF!

Sadly, this super sweet, cuddly polar bear of a dog lost his home when his owner went into the hospital and passed away, so Max ended up in the shelter.

Max knows his commands, is neutered, UTD on all his vaccines, and is microchipped. If you have room in your heart and on your lap for a cuddly dog, apply today at www.gsgsr.org  

Training for Max will be required upon adoption.

We require all adopters attend professional training with their adopted dog.  Exceptions are made for adopters who are K-9 professionals or for senior dogs being adopted.

We are an all volunteer organization and every effort is made to proceed as efficiently as possible with an application. As with all rescues, we do require veterinary references if you have a pet, personal reference, a phone interview and home visit.

This adorable fluffy 3 1/2 year old Yorkie/poodle/Shih Tzu mix is really an insecure little guy looking for the right home.  His previous owners surrendered him to the local pound when he was getting protective of one person in the home from the other.  Since coming to us he has been a sweet little guy and seems more comfortable living with other dogs.  Eddieâs ideal home would be with at least one other dog, and just one person he can feel comfortable with and loyal to.

We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East, Morris Plains, NJ.

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. 

Our dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! 

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)

Our dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  
Please, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!

She's 6 years old, spayed, up to date on her vaccines, on preventives and dewormed. She is friendly to people, good with other dogs and cats. Zest is healthy but due to getting hematomas in both ears when she was younger, her ears no longer stand up all the way. It doesn't make her any less cute or a westie!

This is a referral posting to her owner who is located in southern Virginia. No shipping requests, please. If you would like to adopt Zest, her owner requires you to go in person to meet her. Her adoption fee is $350,

She is accustomed to using a doggy door and so if you have another situation for pottying at your home, she will need a little acclimation and training. She is accustomed to a one level home and a fenced yard, so would also need to be trained to do steps and leash walking if necessary in your environment.

If you are interested in Zest, please contact Erica Cerny at ecerny@optonline.net or 973-361-6790. Pictures will be posted shortly.

- a family in the suburbs or rural area with a fenced, secured yard. Why? Groot can be sound sensitive, so walks are great for him but having a safe yard to play will be beneficial.
- home should have a social dog that likes to play. Groot thrives on having a canine friend. He has spent time in a home with another pup and enjoys playing!
- a family willing to help continue the great improvements he has made with manners and impulse control. He is a fabulous student! Training protocol will be provided by Bully Project.

936,Young,Catahoula Leopard Dog,"Key, the one year old Catahoula Leopard Dog, is still waiting for his Forever Home. In addition to being gorgeous, he is also sweet, social, happy, goofy, intelligent, well-mannered... and deaf. His deafness hasn't slowed him down or held him back one bit. With the exception of using hand signals instead of voice commands, we treat this boy just like every other dog we've ever had, and he goes with the flow no matter where we are or what we're doing. He is housebroken, crate trained, walks nicely on leash with a harness, loves people of ALL ages, and dogs of ALL sizes. I would even feel comfortable saying he would be fine with dog-savvy cats after proper intros, as he's successfully met and interacted with several. He is medium energy, equally happy chasing a ball around the yard, going for a jog, sleeping in on a Saturday, or binge watching Netflix on the couch with you. This pup's sole wish in life is to be your best friend, your constant companion, your snuggle buddy, your adventure partner, your welcome committee, your everything.

* BEHAVIOR DISCLAIMER: We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. All dogs will require supervision with children, other dogs, and cats/other animals regardless of whether or not we have stated that the dog is friendly towards kids, cats, other dogs, etc. Slow introductions to other animals in the home, and allowing for them to have a separate space will make for better relationships in the future. Most dogs need an adjustment period when transitioning into a new home and there may be potty accidents, even if we have stated the dog is housebroken. All dogs should be somehow confined separately (crate or separate room) when left home alone until you can be sure the dog is trustworthy left loose. Separation anxiety can manifest if a dog is left alone more than it is used to in it's new home. This can be worked through and we are here to help. Please do not give up on your new dog without reaching out to us first!

* PUPPY DISCLAIMER: Adopters considering a puppy must be prepared for:
1. Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only ""hold it"" for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break).
2. Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.
3. Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences a puppy has the better, both in and out of your home.
4. Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well adjusted dog. 

Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/1/?bust=1536073318', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/2/?bust=1536073319', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/3/?bust=1544994946', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/4/?bust=1529454115', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/5/?bust=1536073320']",Key,41950924,M,L,A
937,Baby,"Caucasian Sheepdog / Caucasian Ovtcharka, Labrador Retriever","Meet Logan!
And he isn't a dog. He is a sexy beast!
He is this deep-tricolor of salt & pepper grey, midnight black, and chocolate brown. With polka dots. Don't forget those delicate scrumptious polka dots. He has the most fortune-cookie-like ears I'd ever did see. And u just know those big chunky paws smell just like a bowl of Fritos. He's like the Bradley Cooper of dog world.

U would never know it but this beautiful boy that u are looking at did not come to us this way. Far from it. He came to us completely and thoroughly broken. I'm talking the pancake-to-the-ground-frozen-in-fear broken. The night he arrived in foster, it took his foster parents over an hour just to get him into the house from the car. A span of several feet. He couldn't even do that. He collapsed in fear, frozen to the ground, literally unable to move. My God - what happened to him that was so horrific, that the simple act of moving brings about a fear that paralyzes? That isn't fear, though. That is terror. Whoever did these horrid acts certainly was good at their job. Because they left him drained of trust and shattered into pieces.

But in true doggie form, he came back. With tons of love, and yummy peanut butter treats, and comfy couches...he came back. So so quickly, may I add. The main reason we believe it was so quick was because of his doggie foster brothers. They literally transformed him. That is why he must go to a home with at least one other dog. So yes, this is Logan now. Full of joy, and a big rubbery nose, and Frito paws, and just the sweetest grin and huggable body. Logan is crazy smart, super affectionate, and is such  social butterfly.

He is around 10 months old and believed to be a lab/cattle dog mix. Adoption fee is $550 and includes health exam, deworming, up to date vaccines, microchip, bloodwork, neuter, and 30 days of free pet health insurance.

938,Adult,"Golden Retriever, Great Pyrenees","This gorgeous boy is Cooper (originally Sarge) who was adopted 4 years ago by a family who now must return him. He is about 4 1/2 years old & currently weighs 94 pounds. He is a friendly, social boy who is truly a gentle giant. He loves to snuggle & is really great with adults & older kids.

There are 2 young children (under 3 years old) in Cooper's current home & recently Cooper has been snappish with them because he seems to have some pain in his legs. As a result, his family had a basic work up done for him with their vet (he tested negative for Lyme disease, heartworms, and an x-ray showed that his hips are in good shape, but his hind knees may be a source of his pain). He is on a 7day course of anti-inflammatory and pain relief to see if it helps him.

Cooper is fully obedience trained, housebroken, and truly an absolutely wonderful boy. He would do great in a home with no kids, or older kids (who wouldn't startle him). He doesn't attack cats, but he does chase them (he was living with 2 cats, and they mostly avoided him). He would be fine with a smaller dog, but is threatened by larger dogs and wouldn't do well with them.

940,Young,"Jack Russell Terrier, Chihuahua","Hi! My name is Super Sweet Sherrie and I am looking for a loving, forever home.  I was rescued from the streets of Puerto Rico by the President of the rescue and her daughter where I was abandoned and left to fend for myself.  I was so excited and relieved to be rescued.  I knew things were about to get alot better for me :)).  My rescuer loved and cared for me until I was ready to take my liberation flight.

My foster family in Brooklyn, NY says I am a SUPER sweet dog :).  Here is what they say about me :).  Sherrie is super sweet and snuggly. She always wants to know what you're doing, and she feels it's important that everyone stay together in the same room at all times. If you get up for more than five seconds, she selflessly volunteers to keep your pillow warm. She loves toys and likes 
to make sure she has every last one of them with her before she lies 
down. While she's still adjusting to the bustle of the big city, she's 
good on a leash and enjoys walks, and she loves frolicking in the park.

941,Adult,Alaskan Malamute,"Thunder is a handsome 4 year old German Shepherd/Malamute/Wolf mix. He can be aloof and standoffish with strangers, but very affection when he warms up, to the point of being a big goofball! Thunder is a quick learner and knows several commands including sit, down, and spin. He is a very high energy dog and would do best with an experienced, confident owner willing to participate in activities like walking, jogging, and hiking. 

Thunder can be food aggressive, especially over raw food, but is being professionally trained to correct this. He was not socialized to other dogs until he arrived at our rescue, and we have noticed he is awkward around other dogs and has problems communicating, but has not shown any real aggression. He requires a fenced in outdoor enclosure that is at least six feet in height. He was raised inside, but would not settle down or relax in the house. 

Please no small pets such as small dogs or cats. Thunder is part wolf and will only be adopted to areas where wolfdogs are legal to own.

964,Adult,German Shorthaired Pointer,"Meet Tango!  He is a beautiful 4 year old male GSP.   
 
Tango has had a lonely start to life.  He was owned by someone who kept him in a kennel for about 15 hours a day for the first 3.75 years of his life. Her Dad told a coworker about Tango but didn't give him a lot of information other than he was kenneled all day long and needed a new home. 
 
The coworker went and picked him up but was not prepared for the hyper, now not in a kennel pup. He has had Tango for just over a month now.  He tried to help and did the right thing to get him out of a kennel, but unfortunately given his job, and his wife about to have a baby, its not a right fit for them or Tango - he needs someone who can give him attention and training.
 
We had a volunteer meet him and we got all his vetting updated (except a neuter, which we will handle whether before adoption or at the time of adoption).
 
Tango likes to bark on a car road, it's an excited type of bark.  He hasn't gotten out much in his first 3.75 years, so now when he gets out he's a bit over stimulated, but we can't blame him!   
 
Tango is living with 2 dogs, a retriever and a lab.  Tango tries to mount them, we are hoping once he's neutered and settled into a routine he'll stop that behavior.  
 
He's good with kids and regularly is with a 7 year old boy. 
 
He does jump a bit but it's from excitement at first meeting.  He does settle down but he needs someone that can pay attention to him and give him some structure/stability, he's not getting nearly enough exercise that is needed for a young male GSP.
 
Tango likes to chew up his toys, but isn't destructive in the house.  
 
There was someone who took Tango out to try and hunt him and he did amazingly.  Has a great drive and not gun shy. Probably would make a great hunter with some training. 
 
He pulled on the leash A LOT but again he was pretty happy to be out and about. 
 
He is house trained and will tell you when he needs to go outside.
 
Overall, he's a handsome nice , friendly boy.  He just needs a home to give him the attention and exercise he needs, along with some basic structure/stability and he'll blossom into an awesome furry family member!

New Hartford, NY, Oneida County

DARLIN' - A name, a term of endearmentâ¦.so deserved for this sweet 62 lb, 5 year old girl. Surrendered to our care when her person lost their home, Darlin' lost everything too â her person, her home, her safety. Sheâs an amazing dog who is not only housetrained, she heads to the edge of the sidewalk to take care of her business. 

Her leash manners are good; she pulls only when there is a new scent that canât wait to be investigated. Darlin comes with rockstar comments from her former person: sheâs friendly to all people, loves kids, loves baths and will jump into the tub on her own, loves dogs of both genders but prefers males to females, is not a fan of kitties, sleeps on her own bed but will sometimes sneak onto her personâs bed in the middle of the night, loves to jump and give kisses, loves belly rubs, and knows sit (âput it downâ). 

""I loved my time with this sweetheart â she is everything her former owner said and more. Sheâs gorgeous, sweet, playful, snuggly, takes treats gently, has a great smile and gorgeous eyes, is beautifully groomed, loved playing with a plush toy, posed for photos like a pro. Seriously, if you are still reading this and not rushing over to meet her you are missing out on a gem. Darlin' â her name and a very deserved term of endearment, but donât just take my word for itâ¦..see for yourself.""

Darlin is spayed, up to date on shots, and microchipped. This happy, healthy, darling girl DARLIN is ready to meet you! ?

Zeus was adopted as a young pup and renamed Tayto. Unfortunately, he has now been returned to EHR as his family can no longer care for him. He is an energetic boy who would love to have a fenced-in yard. Tayto would benefit from a person who likes to walk or hike - he'd be great with an active owner or family!

Tayto lived with children and is great with them. He isn't around other dogs often but his owners say that he is fine when he sees them and has been to the dog park. Tayto loves to play fetch and is playful and fun to be with.

Please consider adopting Tayto - he is already house and crate trained so he's in ""move in"" condition!

969,Baby,"Labrador Retriever, Pit Bull Terrier","Buddy is a lab/pit mix and is approximately seven months old (as of 9/7/18).  Buddy is a victim of an irresponsible âbackyard breederâ who thought he could make money by breeding his dogs and selling the puppies.  As usual things didnât work out as planned and Buddy, mom, dad and several of his siblings found themselves abandoned.  
Because Buddy was never socialized properly during his formative months everything is new and scary for him.  He will need a quiet and patient home with a family that has the time to commit to working with him to help him gain confidence.  He has been at his foster home for a full month now and has made tremendous strides.  Buddy loves other dogs and a home with another playful dog would be great.  He is also wonderful with the resident cat.  At already 50 pounds Buddy will be a larger dog but that does not stop him from curling up in your lap.  âSweetâ seems to be the common word to describe Buddy anytime someone new meets him.

970,Adult,Shar-Pei,"Miss Rico is one lucky lady! She is a 3 year old Shar Pei mix who was rescued in the nick of time from a kill shelter in North Carolina. Currently, Miss Rico is working on coming out of her shell as she adjusts to life in her foster home. She is very shy and needs some time to warm up to people, but once she does, the affection is endless. On Miss Rico's first day with her foster family she was so skittish â even a blowing leaf startled her. Once she became comfortable in her foster home her playful nature came out! She plays very well with other dogs and would do best in a home with another dog - Miss Rico finds confidence from being part of a pack.

Miss Rico is learning and growing more confident each day! She is highly trainable and is motivated to learn. Miss Rico is fully crate trained - she will go in quickly when asked and will often hang out in there with the door open if she wants some quiet time.

Miss Rico also is a cuddlebug who loves snuggling with blankets and playing with toys. She also loves romping around the yard with other dogs! She is a very sweet pup who just needs someone with the patience to help her get adjusted to her new forever home!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

986,Young,Shepherd,"Don't let the mean-mug fool you!  Beaver is a really nice boy!  He's super friendly and affectionate, and well-behaved.  He was found as a weeks-old baby in a garbage bin in Thailand last December 2017.  He is now a beautiful 11-month old boy, very affectionate and friendly to humans and other dogs, and all around, a great boy. Beaver weighs around 40 lbs.   

Beaver just arrived in NYC at the end of November 2018.  He has been a little bit depressed since arriving.  He had an adopter who unfortunately had to bail out at the last minute, so he has been at a paid sitter.  He has been feeling kind of lonely and is not being stimulated the way he needs to be.  He LOVES other dogs so much, all sizes, all personalities, so, if you have a dog or have neighbors and friends with dogs and live in a dog-friendly area, Beaver would thrive with you.  We took him to a dog run in Brooklyn this past weekend and he had the time of his life and recovered temporarily from his depression.  

He's a good boy--easy to love and easy to care for, never aggressive, always gentle and friendly.  Please consider either fostering or adopting this sweet young boy.

995,Adult,"Black Labrador Retriever, Great Dane","Meet Eclipse, a handsome Black Lab who is very sweet and gentle. Unfortunately, Eclipse has not had the best life in his 5 years. He was picked up as a stray by a rural animal control and taken back to their facility. One picture shows Eclipse in this enclosure - the dog bed is broken and upside down, the dogs are never taken out of their runs to be walked and the runs are even washed with the dogs still inside them! It is not a good place for a dog to land.

When a rescuer saw this dog shaking in the corner of the enclosure, they knew this dog's only chance was to help him get out of there. Eclipse was microchipped but the owner did not want the dog back, and it was later discovered that the owner had been charged with abuse. One can only imagine the life that Eclipse endured.

At first Eclipse is shy, but when he is shown kindness and love, his true personality comes out. Eclipse needs to learn how to trust again, and he desperately wants to be loved, he will warm up more quickly to a woman than a man. He is not aggressive at all, just scared, but he will keep his tail between his legs until he feels more comfortable.

Eclipse will need to be walked on a leash because the rescuers have discovered that he can jump over six foot fences so he cannot be left outside without supervision. With a little patience Eclipse will make a wonderful companion. Eclipse is a big boy at around 70 pounds, and appears to be a purebred black Lab.

Eclipse was tested with other dogs and even a puppy and he did great. After all that Eclipse probably has gone through there is no aggression in this big boy, just shyness.

Eclipse has been neutered and fully vetted, and just needs a family that will love and appreciate the great dog he is. A quieter home without young children would probably be best for Eclipse. Please give this handsome boy a chance, and fill out an application on him today.

997,Senior,Pit Bull Terrier,"MEET SPICE!

As sweet as pumpkin pie with a hint of cinnamon - meet Spice! This beautiful 10.5 year old pit bull mix was surrendered to Philadelphia's animal control shelter because her former owners didn't have the appropriate space for a dog. She lucked out though and caught the eye of a City of Elderly Love foster family before her timestamp for euthanasia was up. She's now happily settled into foster care and ready to find her true forever family!

Spice is just as sweet as her name implies. She loves to curl up at your feet while watching TV, will snuggle up under a blanket if you let her, and while loves a good walk around the block, is also happy to romp in the yard and curl back up inside. She lived with kids and cats in her previous home and is currently living with a Chocolate Lab in foster care. She gets along with him wonderfully and loves snuggling with her foster brother on the couch, floor, really anywhere he curls up.. she'll scoot on over to be next to him. She'd do well in a home with another easy-going dog but would also be happy to get all of your attention! Spice has only met one cat at an adoption event since coming to the rescue and was very interested in him so may do best in a home without cats or with dog-savvy cats with a slow introduction. Spice also previously lived with kids in her former home who reported her to have always loved kids. Plus she has met kids at our events - she's sweet, appropriate and just lays down and enjoys the attention! Spice sure knows how to attract a crowd. Perhaps is her amazing pittie smile or just the natural warmth of her personality. Whatever it is, she's quick to make friends everywhere she goes! Spice is crate trained and housebroken too!

Spice has been evaluated by our vet after leaving the shelter. Besides being treated for a UTI and needing a couple rounds of dewormer, she's proven to be a healthy girl. She's scheduled to be spayed and have a mammary mass removed soon. Spice may be older, but looks and acts like a younger dog. She's healthy and ready to be your baby! 

Spice is available for adoption through City of Elderly Love. She is vaccinated, microchipped and will be spayed prior to going to her forever home. She is also heartworm and lymes disease negative. Interested in adopting her?

themselves at a kill shelter just before Hurricane Florence was about to hit. This shelter had outside dog kennels and they needed to be moved. Some of the siblings also had hip issues and needed immediate surgery to relieve their pain.

Since coming to NJ, Bella has been living with a foster family and is really doing great. She is great with kids and other dogs, though we are not sure how she'd be with cats. She loves to cuddle and is especially snuggly at night, preferring to sleep on the bed with you. She is recovering well from her first surgery hip and has the second scheduled very soon. A very sweet pup, she loves to play and is eager to please, but is not happy away from her humans and so would do better in a home where she is not alone for very long during the day.

She weights in at a just-right 15 pounds.  Bambi was dumped at a high kill shelter with her two tiny newborn puppies, and was a very good mom.  Her foster mom reports that she loves food, sunbathing and walks.  She also loves other dogs, and it is required that she go to a home where she will have a well-balanced canine companion.  Since Bambi has a high flight instinct, she will need a fenced yard to play in.

Bambi will do best in a quieter household without young children.  She is very sweet, but is shy at first with people.  For the right patient and gentle owner, she is very affectionate once she opens up.  

Bambi is UTD on vaccines and is spayed.  Her adoption fee is $375.  Adoption applications can be found at https://snarrnortheast.org/adopt-app/.

Although he seems like a knuckle head, if youâre offering food heâs listening. Bruno is only looking for a family to love and a yard to run in!

1010,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"This happy dog is Ruby, and she is so photogenic. I love taking pictures of her because she has such an aura about her. She was rescued from an abandoned house in Far Rockaway with another dog during Hurricane Sandy by fellow rescuer Christine D. Ruby is a sweetie who has a playful side to her. She is about 5 years old now, and weighing in about 40lbs. She is always happy to see you and will shower you with affection, giving kisses all over your face. Ruby has a lot of energy and could probably win an Olympic sprint! So she would make a great running or exercise partner. She is a pocket pittie and not too big so she would be perfect for any home situation. Ruby needs some training as she can be a little mouthy during play or getting too excited. She would do best as the only pet but that is even better because you'll get to spend that quality one on one time with her. Let's find Ruby a home!

He'd love a home that can keep him active and entertained and mentally stimulated- and can help him learn some tricks and commands! He's fairly food-motivated, and super eager to please. Shaggy could live with kids and other dogs who can handle his enthusiastic energy, although we're not sure how he feels about cats, just yet. He came to PAWS fully matted and had to be completely shaved down to give his fur a clean slate to regrow, so we can confirm his fur will need daily brushing and regular grooming or it will be prone to matting again.

While I may look big and tough, Iâm a big baby at heart.  I can be easily frightened, whether it be by a knock on the door or a person dressed up in a way Iâm not familiar with, but I really mean no harm.  The Behavior Team liked something about me â it must have been my rugged good looks! â and invited me to stay with them in their office.  It was an offer I just couldnât pass up!  Iâm really starting to come out of my shell.  And, the secretâs outâ¦ my tail wags!  How cool is that!!  I know âsitâ, âpawâ, and am very treat motivated, mostly because they help me keep my jolly figure.  I can be playful at times, but also enjoy peaceful naps and.  And what can I sayâ¦ Iâm a belly rub connoisseur!  Because I am so big and can get scared, I would do best in an adult household.

You can meet me at the shelter any time but I also have a very special volunteer buddy who takes care of me so if you want more information or want to set up a time to come meet me with her and get to play with me contact her - she will be happy to hear from you and will answer right away.

Meet Atticus! Atticus is a sweet and VERY playful 9 month old, 45lbs boy, who loves older (9years+) kids and other high energy, or very tolerant dogs. He is housebroken, crate trained, walks on a leash, he knows some basic commands, and will sit and wait for his food! He has no food aggression, and does not seem to be dominant when it comes to other dogs. Atticus has been living in a wonderful, loving foster home with two other dogs and a few cats. He DOES NOT get along with the cats at all. When he sees a cat he fixates and will not redirect at this time in his life; because of this he must be in a home WITHOUT cats. Atticus will do best in a home where he can have access to a high energy playmate! His ideal dog sibling will be a dog who either matches his level of excitement, or a dog that will tolerate his excitement. His current housemates are older dogs who donât always appreciate his playfulness and Atticus does not pick up on these clues. He doesnât understand that they donât want to play. This wonderful energy could be stressful to an older or less tolerant dog. Atticus embodies all of the qualities we look for in a puppy, heâs happy, loving, sweet, loves to give kisses, eager to learn, and heâs coming to know that cuddling is one of lifeâs many pleasures. He will brighten up any home with his beautiful spirit. If you are interested in adopting Atticus please go to:

Despite my size I am still just a pup; Iâm a 2 year old, neutered, Black-Mouth Cur mix. I am in great health and up to date on my shots. Iâm full of energy and I love to go on walks and play play play. I do tend to pull on my leash when I see other dogs but only because I love to make new dog friends. Did I mention that I am also a dancer? Whether I know you or we just met I have a habit of jumping up and trying to do a little tango. When Iâm not trying to bust a move I love to cuddle and lay around the house. Like all dogs, Iâm a cutie, but Iâm not perfect. I must admit that I am possessive over my toys and sometimes I take things that are not mine. I have been experiencing some growing pains recently, and Iâve outgrown my current home. Iâm looking for a new owner who has some experience training a high-energy pup like myself.

My dream forever home would be with someone or with a couple, preferably without small children, who can dedicate themselves to working with me and guiding me to become the best boy I can possibly be.  From the tips of my buttery soft ears all the way down to my big doofy paws I know I am good boy and I can be an even better boy in time. It would mean the world to me if you could contact my dear friend Caryn about adopting me! Sheâs very friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have about me. You can call or text her at 845-372-8534 or email her at cbyllott@gmail.com.

I hope to hear from you soon! Have a pawsome day!""

Reese knows basic obedience commands like sit, watch me, paw, and down. He is a dog who would be great as a walking or hiking partner as he loves to be active and outside. He even enjoys swimming!

1039,Young,"Australian Cattle Dog / Blue Heeler, Golden Retriever","Our Circles gives the impression of shyness at first, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. He must have quite the tale to tell, after having paid his dues as a big city stray. Circles came to us via our contacts at NYCACC, where he was passed over for adoption during his short window of opportunity. Nonetheless he made friends and admirers of Shelter and Vet staff.

Circles appears to be a handsome mix of Australian Cattle Dog and yellow Labrador Retriever. He has the physique and color of a yellow Lab, and the speckled markings of the Cattle Dog. Weighing 57 pounds, Circles has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Circles loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. 

Circles sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the necessary structure that he needs to thrive.Â He seems subdued, and intimidated at times, and is not a good candidate for a home with small children, or a busy home with a lot of strangers coming and going. 

Circles would thrive in an adult home, with patient folks were willing to troubleshoot some stranger danger issues. He would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, and is greatly suited to a slow-paced country lifestyle.Â He can keep brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality.Â Circles could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.

Circles has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. We've worked with him for quite a while on food and resource guarding, and he has improved greatly. Still, it's best to leave Circles alone while eating, and to feed him separately from any other dogs. The obedience work serves him as a job, he takes pride in it, and performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats.Â Obedience training is key to the providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.

Circles has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Circles' transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptosporosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped.

1041,Adult,"Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier","Hello there, my name is Petey :) Clearly you can see that I am just a handsome boy! I was taken into Eleventh Hour when my recent owners could no longer care for me. Since coming to EHR I have met many wonderful people. My foster who takes me home says I am housebroken, know all my basic commands (and a few bonus extras)

UPDATE FROM CURRENT HOME:

In the time we have had him Petey has improved his understanding of basic commands (sit, stay, down) as well as learned some new ones. We have been working on ""Leave it"" and ""Drop it"" and he has been responding well. We also are able to get him to wait for his food until we give the ""OK"" and are able to stop him eating with ""leave it."" We have not noticed any type of food aggression with him, he takes treats very nicely and won't take a treat until we say ""OK"".

Petey is very good in the crate. When we first got him we tried to leave him in the house all day and he had an accident on the carpet EVERY day. We tried baby gates and barriers and he always jumped them. We figured it was a separation anxiety reaction from him. Since we started using the crate he has not had one accident and comes and goes from it on his own when the door is open. It definitely keeps him calm when we are out of the house. We do have him sleep in it at night as well, but he of course would love to just be in bed with us all night if he could. He is such a snuggler, still very affectionate and just wanting to be by us all the time.

We definitely feel like he needs to be an only dog in a family with no children and who wouldn't have him interact with small animals or children. He definitely needs a lot of attention and love. We think he would love to run around and play in a high fenced yard.
He also now responds to the name Dexter.

Sandy is looking for someone she can enjoy her golden years with, someone who can just love her, cuddle her, and make her feel like a princess. 

22 Jan 2017: Sandy is a 9 year old lab-shepherd mix. She is a well-behaved girl who would love to spend her golden years as a cherished family member. Instead, though, she landed in a kill shelter and now sits in boarding (where she has been for far too long), just hoping that someone will make her a part of their family. Sandy is a big girl, weighing about 90 lbs! And as you can see, she is a beauty. Sandy would do best in a home where there are no other dogs or a very submissive dog that is about her size.

Sandy has been posted and marketed a lot but seems to keep getting passed over. It is so very sad. Wonât someone give her a chance? Sandy is located in New Windsor, NY (not too far from Poughkeepsie). Why not visit her and see if thereâs a love match? If you have another dog, you will need to bring him/her along.

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

Hi, my name is Denali, and I am as beautiful and majestic as the Alaskan mountain for which I am named! As a female Great Pyrenees, I have lovely snowy white fur and double dew claws. I love being outside and exploring nature, but now I am looking for my furever home. You see, I was found wandering in the road and taken to the local animal shelter before I was rescued and placed with my foster mom. She says that I can be a little shy at first, but I can tell you that I warm up quickly despite my snowy name! Iâm a gentle girl, and I am getting along well with my foster brother. Iâm house trained, and I do well in my kennel and my crate. Please know that I am still a young lady, so I have boundless energy. Speaking of boundless, I need to tell you that I can jump a four foot fence when I want to get to my foster mom on the other side :) So my furever home should have a tall, sturdy fence, since having a mountain for my namesake, Iâm good at scaling heights!

Chaos needs a new home and a new name ? 
Chaos is a very sweet 3 1/2 year old 70lbs American Bull dog , who has spent the last 3 years outside in the yard. He deserves to become part of a family.   He is extremely affectionate and loves people. 
No one , except the neighbor , pays attention to poor Chaos.
The neighbor said he actually cries trying to get someoneâs attention. 
The owners say, that they have no time for him and are willing to surrender. 
He will be neutered and is now up to date on shots. 
He will need someone willing to help him to make an adjustment to life as a family member.   He has no experience of things and life outside the yard. He is the dog in the plastic bubble and will need someone who is willing to spend time with him and expose him to things and show him what it is like to be part of a family. 
He has not been socialized with dogs.  He hasnât been with cats 
No small children due to his size. 
For now heâs probably better as a single dog. 
Upon adoption, he will be provided with all the Free Dog Training necessary. 
Please adopt and share your life with this great guy.
Heâs desperate for it ??

She is very eager to please and smart. She loves attention!!! Megara is very playful with female dogs, but seems to have conflict when introduced to male dogs; therefore we will only adopt her to a home with another female or as an only dog.

Megara's adoption fee is $495, which includes transport from the South.

If a dog is listed on Petfinder, he/she is still available. We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the dog(s). Please keep in mind that we are taking our best guess on breed and age based on the dogs physical appearance.

1057,Young,Beagle,"Before you ask about Vinny please read the full description.  Vinny is NOT your typical easy  going sweet beagle.  I know the photo is misleading however he can be quite the charmer with MEN.  Vinny is a self-conscious type of dog and is very suspicious of human motives when approached.  We attribute this to unpleasant early life experiences.  Vinny will do well in a home with just one man or a couple with dog experience.  Although good a on leash we just don't trust his behavior if a child were to run up to him or a person wanting to prove all dogs love them bends over his head.  He'd be OK in a  fenced yard and walks taken where there is limited exposure to encountering others.  Nose to the ground in the country he's probably a great candidate as a hunting dog.  He's more of that type of beagle than a docile house pet.    His guesstimated age is about three years of age and he was rescued from a Newark, NJ shelter. He weighs in the range of 25 pounds.   He enthusiastically runs to you when called,  sits politely for food, guarding a bone is another matter so no long lasting treats for Vinny.  He goes to his bed/crate when asked,  He opts to hide under a flannel blanket curled up so tight that you don't even know he's inside the blanket so of course he feels a little vulnerable when you wake him. He's a late sleeper and he grumbles when he doesn't want to get up but we all know someone like this! He's a very clean dog too that takes his business outdoors. Vinny likes car rides.   He's is OK with cats and great with other usually bigger dogs. Bottom line if you're a single male in a more suburban or country location, don't have kids; like to hike for long periods of time Vinny could really make a turn around  in his behavior.  I believe the key to his success is sufficient exercise to relieve his tension coupled with a protocol for rehabilitating his unwanted quirks.

1061,Young,Beagle,"Hi.  My name is Maggie and I am a young and pretty female beagle that is looking for a new home.  I am approx. 2 years old and weigh 26 lbs.  I used to live in a rabbit hutch in New Jersey with my other beagle âsiblingsâ.  Penny Angels recently rescued me (and my brother, Peanut) from that sad situation.  I am a shy girl when I first meet people, but I do slowly warm up to them.  I am coming around, but it will take a little time.  I wasnât socialized in my previous home, so everything is new to me.  I learned how to use the doggie door in Rescue and that is a good thing.  I would do best in a quiet home without small or active young children.  I would like to have a doggie friend in my new home, though I think that I would be okay on my own, too.  I will need some help with leash-walking but if you have a secure fenced-in yard, that would be fine with me.  Please make sure that I canât escape from your yard; if I get out, you will have a difficult time trying to get me back.

My new owner should either have some experience in dealing with shy dogs OR be willing to spend extra time working with me.  I want to learn to be your loyal and loving companion, so I hope that you will be patient with me.  I was recently spayed and microchipped.  I will be at PetSmart in Mays Landing, NJ on Saturday from 11- 3 pm.  Please fill out an application and submit it to Penny Angels TODAY if you are ready to make a lifetime commitment to me.

An adoption application for Maggie can be obtained by visiting our web site at www.pennyangelsbeaglerescue.com. If you have any questions, please contact beagler534@comcast.net or emnase@aol.com, or call Penny Angels Beagle Rescue at 609-965-9476. Thank you!

If you are interested in adopting Johnny, please fill out an application here: www.wiseanimalrescue.org/adoption-application

Meet Johnny! He is a 6-month-old Black Lab puppy ready to find his forever home!

He is an easygoing dog who LOVES to cuddle anytime and anywhere. He wants everyone he meets to hold him and give him lots of pets. In return, he will cover your face in kisses to show how much he loves you! While he is still a puppy, he is not rambunctious but enjoys a good romp in the yard.

A note from Johnny's foster mom: ""Johnny is one of the sweetest foster puppies we have ever had! All he wants is for you to love him. Whenever you sit down, he is ready to curl up on your lap. He will usually rest his head on my chest or shoulder.  He will usually lay in his dog bed or on the couch when he is not playing outdoors or with his toys. He loves tennis balls and squeaky toys! He always aims to please and is a great listener.""

Johnny is working on learning his basic commands and has mastered ""sit"", ""paw"", ""down"", ""come"" and ""crate"". He is very food motivated and eager to learn. He sleeps through the night in his crate and is doing great with his potty training! Johnny walks great on a leash and enjoys going on walks! He would do wonderfully in a home with another dog and can also live with children 10 and up. 

If you're looking for a loving, sweet puppy, adopt Johnny!

1068,Baby,"Terrier, Chocolate Labrador Retriever","Oh how pretty Ms.Lily! 

As many of you may know Lily was one of our severe mange cases, rescued back in the beginning of October. This girl literally never had a home before. She grew up on the streets with her brother since birth, and were only given a second chance because a few kind hearted people saw their deteriorating condition. Lily was a bit worse off than her brother Lance. She had developed a cyst the size of a grapefruit along her neck due to infection and underwent 3 surgeries to have it removed.

1069,Adult,Shepherd,"Lotus has a remarkable story! Lotus is blind and was fighting for survival on the streets of Thailand as a stray. She was taken in by a woman who had too many dogs and was put back on the street and could not be located for weeks. Once she was found, a Thai rescue organization sent out an urgent plea for a foster in the United States. Lotus' foster mom accepted and the organization flew her by plane to the United States after shots and quarantine. 

This young adult shepherd mix with fabulous ears is very smart and figured out a doggie door in just 2 days. She loves squeaky toys and any toy at all, since she never had any. She wags her tail and body whenever she hears her foster mom's voice. She loves affection and laying with humans. 

Lotus is very protective of her food when other dogs are near. A survival instinct she learned on the streets of Thailand. Because of this, we feel she would do best in a home with no other dogs.

She was examined by an ophthalmologist and it was concluded that she does see shadows.  

For more information on this beautiful survivor who has so much love to give please contact Michelle at:   cabweirich2284@comcast.net",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/37766943/1/?bust=1491223345'],LOTUS FROM THAILAND,37766943,F,M,A

When to Come:
Unless noted differently above, our hours are Monday-Saturday 10am-4pm and Sunday 1pm-4pm. Our adoptions are first come, first served based on the status of your application.

1084,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, Beagle","This 6 year old, 35lb, Lab/Beagle sweetheart is Squeaker. Her life turned upside down recently after her prior owners did not want her anymore and dropped her off at the local kill shelter, where she was very scared and confused. Squeaker was moved into foster so she could heal her broken heart after being abandoned. In her foster home, Squeaker was quickly accepted by the 4 other resident dogs. She eats, sleeps and walks the fenced yard with them in harmony, like she has always belonged. The quick acceptance is most likely credited to her gentle and low key personality. Squeaker is calm in the house, has not had one accident inside, has not shown any interest in chewing household items, and is a nice leash walker. She goes in her crate with the help of a good treat or bone and waits patiently for your return.
While Squeaker gets along with all of the other dogs, her preferred, favorite spot is always beside her person. She is a very loyal and loving girl, who will no doubt be a wonderful companion!
Squeaker may not have had the best life in her previous home. She has a torn ear, which has completely healed now, and quick movements make her a little nervous; we feel homes without young children would be more suitable. Despite her past, this little lady is ready to start the next chapter and find out how good the second half of her life can be!

It was soooo nice there, I even got some duck treatsâ¦yum! You really should come meet me and see all the commands that I know now. My foster parents constantly hug me and tell me what a smart boy I am. I really like people, I find them so exciting! Oh, and did I mention that I could also make an excellent running partner for any of you runners out there?!


This dog is currently in a foster home. If you're interested in adopting please email us at volaux@yahoo.com for an adoption application. All dogs are UTD on shots and spayed/neutered prior to adoption.

Lando is a one-in-a-million dog. He is stunning and has the personality to back up the good looks! He unfortunately has not be treated as he deserves for most of his young life. He ended up as a stray and was brought to a city shelter where he stayed for way too long of a time. His time in that shelter led to bad habits and him having a difficult time connecting with new people.

Since arriving at Adopt-A-Dog, we have seen a nice change in Lando's personality and sociability with new people. He now is always ready to give a kiss and get a hug!

Oh Miss Bea... if only you could tell us your story...

Miss Bea comes to us from a rural VA shelter where she was found roaming with Barney (we believe Barney is her son). Her teeth show signs of wear from chewing on wire, or rocks, or who knows what which makes guessing her age difficult. We will just say that she is no spring chicken. Miss Bea loves to ""beagle"" in her fosters back yard and thinks tracking is a blast. She's still got some get up and go, at least enough to follow that beagle nose so we would love for her to go to a home with a fenced yard. Besides that Bea is just looking for a place to rest her head. She has had multiple liters and her body shows it. She is a good girl, good with other dogs, fine with cats, great with people. She like Barney is figuring out what a ""home"" is all about. Miss Bea deserves a nice place to rest her head.Adoption Application http://www.thelastresortrescue.com/adopt","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42936534/1/?bust=1543296985', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42936534/2/?bust=1543296996', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42936534/3/?bust=1543297006']",Miss Bea,42936534,F,M,A

I have a few health issues (a skin infection, an ear infection, a fatty tumor, and arthritis) that are currently being treated by my favorite vet and am ready to start looking for my forever family!

I get along wonderfully with other dogs, and cats are okay too! My foster mom is making sure I have lots of experiences, and so far, the only thing I don't have a lot of interest in are small children. They are just too busy for an old man like me!

Again, I do not think my perfect house comes with small children. I would prefer a quieter home where I can curl up on the sofa and take long naps!

I was scared in the shelter and luckily PLDP stopped by and scooped me up. A little about myself. I am a nine year old distinguished guy. Adorably distinguished of course! I am house-trained. I am currently living with a twelve year old boy, and two others dogs. I am not sure how I feel about cats yet but I can be tested with them if needed. I have a lot of energy and keep up with the three year old dog where I live now.  My vision and hearing is not the best these days so I do better with bigger dogs and especially like the ladies.  I have a habit of whining sometimes when a car goes by because I cannot always see it or hear it, but I feel the vibration and it makes me bark sometimes.  But other than that, I am a real catch!  I really like to be with my person, and would do better in a home where I am not alone a lot. I love to be pet, cuddle and I am also quite fond of giving kisses. I enjoy romping around outside, and taking walks and snuggling with my owner at night.   I am neutered, micro-chipped, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm negative.

NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

This adorable young boy is Goose, a total sweetheart who just loves everybody! Goose loves dogs, is fine with cats, and adores kids and people of all ages. Goose came in to rescue on a very crowded week from an Animal Control. He only made it out because we had a wonderful foster who made room for one more. Goose is a Hound/Great Pyrenees mix, young and silly, but super sweet. He was abandoned and on his own for some time, starved for both food and affection. He is very thin but getting great care now in his foster home. This is one very sweet boy! Goose is housebroken and knows basic commands. He would just love a great home and family of his own to spoil him so he will never have to be lonely and abandoned again. He is currently being fed separately from all of the other dogs in his foster home so he can gain some much needed weight. He is currently 80 pounds so he will be a large boy once he fills out. Unfortunately you can see and feel every bone in his body now, but he is so happy to be safe in rescue. Hounds are a dime a dozen in the southern states (in many places so are Pyrenees) but this is one great combo. We are so thankful Goose is safe in rescue and cannot wait till he finds his furever home. Goose would love a doggie companion or two and he is especially great with children of all ages. Just a lovely mix of two great breeds looking for an amazing home!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43400330/1/?bust=1543433979', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43400330/2/?bust=1543433986', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43400330/3/?bust=1543433995']",Goose,43400330,M,L,A

Ashes would love to find herself a home where she can run and play and be part of a family. Because Ashes does best with a canine companion, we are looking to place her into a home with another friendly dog (or dogs) where she can thrive. She is a very active, happy girl. She even gets along with cats. Our volunteers love her because she is so sweet & she has made some doggie friends at the kennel while she waits for her forever home.

Ashes is a beautiful young Labrador Retriever mix who weighs about 55 pounds & who walks well on a leash. She will make a wonderful pet for any family looking for an active pup - she's young and has the energy you normally find a in a younger dog. She'd be a great buddy for someone who enjoys spending time outdoors.

Ashes is currently in a foster home with a wonderful German Shepherd friend & they get along so very well together. As you can see in her video, she & her foster sister love to go swimming!

1135,Baby,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Boxer","Constantine originally came from North Carolina as an 8 week old pup. He was adopted, but unfortunately they found out their 3 year old boy is very allergic to him and brought him back to our rescue.
Constantine is about 6 months old and a typical puppy.  He is a Boxer/ Staffy mixed with some other breeds,  weighs about  40 pounds and is all legs. Guessing he will be the size of a Boxer when all grown up.  Constantine is well on his way with potty training. He had a few accidents the first few days being back at rescue, but has not had an accident since and runs right to the door to go out. Constantine is crate trained and does pretty on a leash. He LOVES other dogs and children and Adults. He is an all around happy go lucky guy.
Constantine is neutered, microchipped and up to date on all of his vaccines. If you are interested in Constantine, please fill out an application at www.itavar.com

1138,Adult,Great Pyrenees,"ADOPTION PENDING. You can see more of these beautiful dogs by going to  NGPR RESCUE DOGS at  https://nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs

NYS Registered Rescue # RR102
NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

Belly-rub experience needed! Looking for a relaxed, affectionate companion? Ivy is another example of the happy transformations we love to see in rescue. Found as a stray, she was dropped off at the foster's house on a Christmas Eve, huddled under the legs of her rescuer in the front seat of a truck. After being treated for ehrlichia, going through heartworm treatment and being spayed, she's become one of those big, sweet girls who wants to get along with everyone and everything. She's ""pyrfect"" in that she is submissive and playful with male dogs; tiptoes gently in between the gaggle of cats there at feeding time (and ignores the ones who swat at her), and has sauntered calmly among a couple of goats and donkeys. Ivy is a ""people pleaser"" who would love to accompany you on leash walks, and so far, not a big barker at all. She's pretty much unflappable (except that she wasn't too pleased with her summer ""haircut"", which will grow back!) and doesn't seem to have issues with anyone or anything, just happy to have attention and be as close to you as possible. Ivy is waiting patiently for a family to love and give her the belly rubs that always make her smile :)","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41877968/1/?bust=1528823912', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41877968/2/?bust=1528823917', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41877968/3/?bust=1528823923']",Ivy in MO - pending,41877968,F,XL,A
1139,Young,English Pointer,"Hi, I'm Zeke. I'm a 3 year old English Pointer that is looking for a forever home. If you dont know much about my breed let me fill you in. We are hard driving, processing stamina, courage and always wanting to go on adventures. Though dignified and sweet-natured, we are packed with energy and we should be with a family who will give us the running exercise we need to feel satisfied. Our breed gets bored easily, that's when we start to look for something to do on our own. With strangers, most English Pointers are slightly reserved, but not me. I love everyone and will make sure you know it!
The English Pointer can be a bit stubborn and that is why the rescue quickly trained me all my basic manners. Since I'm very sensitive like most pointers, I respond well to patience and  positive training that includes food rewards and praise . My new family will also have to help remind me to demonstrate impulse control when I get excited.
I'm ready for my new home, if you are an active family with dog experience that can give me the exercise I need please come meet me. You will fall in love with me and wonder how you ever lived without me.

1145,Adult,Mixed Breed,"Watts is one incredibly special little guy... reserved with the most joyful, endearing inner spirit that comes out in the form of wiggles and thumping tail wags! 

You'll see in his videos on our website fortheloveofdogsrescue.org, Watts has some places where he has become super comfortable (that shows with high happy tail, head held high, loose body and relaxed eyes) and other, new areas on the property that cause him to shrink into his shell like a turtle. Like we do with all of our dogs, as soon as they arrive here they are put in a very predictable and simple routine with handlers that complement what the dogs needs at that time.  Watts got comfy within his routine in a short period of time. in the meantime he quickly began to trust and adore his handlers and trainer. 

Watts loves other dogs and thrives in playgroup with his buddies Finney, Jessie and Orly. He is absolutely his happiest out there.. you'll see his tail whipping in huge circles, mouth WIDE open with a huge smile and wiggles all over the map. He runs up to his human friends and does a sweet lean looking for affection. 

Watts has only been with us for two weeks so we are still getting to know him and his true personality under his guarded layers. he really is a dog that once you meet him, you will understand just how special he is! Stay tuned for updates but in the meantime, come out to meet this gentle soul!

KC enjoys his walks, and looks forward to putting his nose to the ground to catch a scent of some wild life. Due to his past, KC MUST be the only pet in the home, with no children at all.

This dog is located at the SPCA at 590 North State Road in Briarcliff Manor, NY 10510 (www.spca914.org). Please apply with the SPCA if you are interested in this dog and read the details below!

I'm eligible for critter credit!! With my adoption, you will receive a $1,000 credit toward a select trainer or a gift card to Petco or Petsmart!! 
Critter Credit cannot be used towards adoption fee. 

We are so proud of Sadie -- and from that smile on her face, she's pretty proud of herself, too! She just passed her C.L.A.S.S. B.A. and M.A. test! C.L.A.S.S. stands for Canine Life and Social Skills, and by earning her B.A. and her M.A., Sadie has shown that she's mastered things like meet and greets, loose leash walking, stay, settle, leave it, and more. In other words, she's one smart, well trained pup! It's time for our star student to go home

Sadie is around 10 years old and she's a real brindle beauty! She may have a little grey in her muzzle, but she's got a lot of pep in her step. She's active, playful, and very friendly. Sadie loves spending time with people. She's not a fan of other dogs or cats. She's a mature girl who's well-mannered and will make a great companion, adventure buddy, and best friend. If you'd like to spend your days playing fetch or going for long walks, and your nights snuggling with a furry best friend, Sadie might just be the girl for you!

Nelda is thankfully safe with us now after wandering into a car wash where she remained until we had her picked up and transported to our Houston Vet Partner. Nelda is just a baby, and already has been suffering and neglected. She had a terrible skin infection, was very malnourished, and anemic from her skin being so bad. She has gotten all of the medical care that she needs and is now looking and feeling so much better! She has been doing wonderful in her foster home but is ready for a home to call her very own! This little princess deserves only the best from here on out...are you the one that can give this to her?! She is such a sweet and loving pup who is friendly with people of all ages and other dogs.

1159,Adult,Jack Russell Terrier,"This dog is a courtesy post on the Mid-Atlantic Jack site. This dog is not in our rescue but the owner wishes to have the dog placed in a loving forever home. If you are interested in this dog please contact Kaitlyn for more information. 


This is Bella: a 3 year old jack russell in need of a loving home - preferably a home with NO small children or other animals. She comes from a home where they did not have the time for her, and loud/wild children that made her very uncomfortable and stressed. She loves to run around outside no matter what the weather , eat snacks and cuddle on the couch. She is smart and energetic, and needs a family to invest the time and effort to properly train and socialize her. She learns best in a calm environment. Enjoys fuzzy sweaters and fuzzy blankets. She takes a while to get comfortable with you and to trust you, but once she does she is the sweetest girl youâll ever meet.  

Please contact Kaitlyn at 717-701-2501 (text or call) for more information.

1163,Baby,German Shepherd Dog,"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. **Be sure to watch Greta's training, sleepy morning & playtime with foster siblings video's below!**
NO Kitties for Greta **
Greta's Meet Your Match Designation is: Wallflower - Shy yet charming canine searching for patient owner with relaxed lifestyle. Looking for gentle guidance to help me come out of my shell. Treat me sweet and kind and Iâll blossom
I know Greta's photo looks like an adult dog but when you see her in person & on the videos below, you can see just how young & this little girl is! At least youâll be able to see what she will look like as a stunning adult GSD!
Greta & her sister Ingrid are 6-month old puppies (Ingrid has an adoption pending) and found themselves in a very crowded shelter in KY when their owners simply said they didnât want them anymore. They are clearly purebred German Shepherds, but on the petite side for GSD'S. I believe they will be between 50-60 lbs full grown.
Both of the girls were abused & they need someone who has experience with abused dogs in the past. They have already come so far just in the last few weeks living in my home. My sincere hope is that someday they will forget their past & just live for today where there are lots of nice people. She'll heal mentally but she needs a quiet home & lots of love & patience.
They are SUPER intelligent. Both girls have extremely soft & gentle dispositions & they are so affectionate, they really crave attention! They put their paws (gently) on your thighs & all they are trying to do is to get hugs. Usually, we discourage putting their paws on us --- but Iâm letting them do it since they need to feel loved & safe. I have found that when the KY pups & dogs arrive, they have seldom been pets the way they are to us. Most of the dogs live outside their whole life, usually chained up & they have never had a chance to BE puppies! Even adult dogs have to learn how to play with toys because theyâve never had any toys in their previous life.

GSDâs are known for being very intelligent which is why they are often used by the police & military & I can attest to their intelligence because when I'm watching these girls behavior I can SEE them thinking! So, that means they must be adopted by experienced pet parents & their new parents will have to be at least as smart as they are so you can keep us with them!

There is a video below showing what I see every morning when we all get up for the day. Of all the pups & dogs here in my home, Greta likes to âsleep in.â While all the other dogs run outside to potty she just keeps rolling around & doesnât seem the least bit in a hurry to get up. So, if you like to sleep in too, maybe sheâll be the perfect girl for you. Greta has just started doing the cutest thing â she has started to âsmileâ at me, it is so cute!

Both girls are perfectly healthy, do not have Heartworms & have a clean bill of health from my Vet. They have had all their shots, have been spayed & microchipped. They are in the process of professional dog training (see video below) and they are learning leash manners so they wonât drag you down the streets, and basic commands. Of course, they are both excelling in their training.

If Greta sounds like the kind of girl you would love to bring into your home & life, be sure to read our adoption requirements which are listed on the left side of our website. If you can meet or exceed you can apply online.

We accept or credit cards & PayPal for the adoption fee

Aslina was born at our vet 2 months ago. Her mother was kicked on the streets as a pregnant dog . She was brought by animal control in a high kill shelter . There was no minute to loose to save her and her unborn puppies .

Unfortunately 7 puppies of the litter of 10 died right away when distemper hit them . Only 3 survived . Aslina and her 2 brothers .

Her mother is Aslani who is an ANATOLIAN Shepherd . We do not know who the father is .

They will arrive this Saturday at our vet in Huntington.

We are looking for a new forever home for this little cupcake .

We do not keep puppies in reserve and these will be the last puppies of the year .

Aslina is treated for distemper but will be still 2 months more contagious what means you have to stay away from public places and your dog had to be up to date on their shots . It is not contagious for cats .

1165,Senior,Pit Bull Terrier,"I am the oldest dog in our shelter and I have been here half of my life. Sprocket is my name and I am the best boy in the world. I have been patiently waiting for a chance to prove it to my forever family. I have had some pretty rough experiences. These are the parts of my life that I have chosen to forget, but people see them all over my body. Good fortune came my way when Eleventh Hour Rescue saved me from the streets of Jersey City. They cleaned me up and made sure I was fully recovered.

I am easy to take care of with a very short coat that needs occasional brushing mostly because I love it. I don't like to walk very far, but exercise is as important for my mind as it is for my body. I like to walk for about 15 minutes. I am built for comfort not for speed. I like to play with a jolly ball and to spend time outside sniffing around. I love to sit on a bench with a kissable human. I am a little shy with new people and I don't like loud noises. I will let you know I am unhappy about it by heading back indoors.

A greeting from me means hoisting my ""low to the ground"" little body up as close as I can get and giving lots of kisses. When it is time for you to go I will head for my comfy bed and settle in with a toy and a Nylabone to chew. I learned to sleep in my crate, too. I may need a little time to get used to sleeping in a crate again after having a kennel run for a while, but I am a smart boy!

Here are some obedience things I know: sit, down, stay, walking nicely on a leash with very little pulling.

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions in NYC only. Out-of-state/non-local adoptions are rare and are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of NYC. We also do not do same-day adoptions NOR do we select adopters on a âfirst-come, first-servedâ basis. We thoroughly review all applications/check references after each event and THEN determine which adopters are the best match for each dog. After selecting who we feel is the best fit, we notify you by phone/email to arrange for a time to conduct a home visit and finalize the adoption. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience.

Buffett is a very good boy. He is good with people, and will enjoy a home with kids older than 10.  This handsome boy has impeccable house manners, and we know he  came to us from a place where he was well-cared for and he has been a happy house pet for some time.

These are Buffett's needs:

1. People who get boxers. Boxers are dorks. He just happens to be 1/2 Great Pyrenees which mellows out the boxer some.
2. A fenced yard to play in or someone who will give him the exercise he needs.
3. Dog friends are cool. Unless they jump on his head.  Despite being a bit of a dork, the Pyr in this boy shines true here.  He will do best with other non-bouncy dogs.
4. Like most Boxers, Buffett thinks cats are for chasing.. Kind of like squirrels and small woodland creatures.  Buffett can live with cats, but only dog savvy ones. 
5. Snacks. This dog is food-motivated and will do just about anything for a cookie.
7. An extra plus couch of a super comfy dog bed. He's kind of the princess and he would definitely notice a lentil under 10 layers of mattresses.

Just like his namesake, all he wants to do is drink margaritas and eat cheeseburgers in paradise.

If you are interested in adopting this dog, please FIRST apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/, then email Corey@bigfluffydogs.com

Our Website www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the adoption process. 

NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION DUE TO THE SHEER NUMBER WE GET DAILY. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE MIGHT NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. 

* BEHAVIOR DISCLAIMER: We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. All dogs will require supervision with children, other dogs, and cats/other animals regardless of whether or not we have stated that the dog is friendly towards kids, cats, other dogs, etc. Slow introductions to other animals in the home, and allowing for them to have a separate space will make for better relationships in the future. Most dogs need an adjustment period when transitioning into a new home and there may be potty accidents, even if we have stated the dog is housebroken. All dogs should be somehow confined separately (crate or separate room) when left home alone until you can be sure the dog is trustworthy left loose. Separation anxiety can manifest if a dog is left alone more than it is used to in it's new home. This can be worked through and we are here to help. Please do not give up on your new dog without reaching out to us first!

1179,Adult,"Terrier, Chihuahua","Blind Dog Rescue Alliance will transport within reasonable distance. Charlotte is being fostered in PA.

what we know about Charlotte:
*vision impaired with cataracts, prescription creme helps
*smart girl!
*loves to snuggle

What Charlotte's foster mom says about Charlotte:
Charlotte is a very lovable girl. She was picked up as a stray shortly before arriving with BDRA. Her foster home consists of seven dogs and she has growled at all of them at one time or another. She has also snapped at three of them. After being with them a couple months she has settled in and now will play with most of the other dogs. She is food aggressive and that may be due to what she endured while living on the street. She is housebroken and we are working on leash training. 

Charlotte is diabetic and it is under control with the least expensive insulin. She likes to snuggle and be under the blankets. She would make a very good companion for a person or couple with one or no other pets. She is good with younger children. She has taught herself how to climb up and down stairs and is a very bright girl! Her favorite thing to do is lay in your arms like a baby and have her belly rubbed, she could do that for hours! Blind Dog Rescue Alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41206919/1/?bust=1521379502', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41206919/2/?bust=1527614356', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41206919/3/?bust=1527614357', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41206919/4/?bust=1527614357', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41206919/5/?bust=1529885158', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41206919/6/?bust=1529885159']",Charlotte: snuggles!

Obviously, she has a lot to learn having never been taught the basics.  She will need a devoted family (single, couple, etc) to show her the ropes of house training, leash walking etc.  She will get started on that here, but here is not a home.

It has been rough going for him for the last year and he is so grateful to his foster dad for loving him.  After being in a large, crowded shelter for a very long time, he was transferred to another facility because his time was up and everyone wanted him to have another chance. 
    
Sadly without the staff and volunteers that he knew so well and feeling alone and isolated, he became depressed and shut down. He was not going to make it out :( Until we rescued him because we knew his beautiful spirit would shine once he knew he was not abandoned by his friends. And that is exactly what happened! 

He is getting a little older but still has that puppy enthusiasm for life. All he wants is someone to tell him he's a good boy and to come home to him at night,  and he will  let you know that he is overflowing with joy to see you home :)   He loves to explore the outdoors with his person and is up for any activity that is planned for him. He is good natured when meeting new friends, understanding of active little dogs that want to play with him and think they are as big as he is, and is learning beautiful manners so that he is a wonderful ambassador for his breed. He will make his family proud and will be your  most devoted companion.

Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

Due to chronic lung issues, Benson will need restricted exercise and often have to go on antibiotics as he will be more susceptible to pneumonia.This condition is considered terminal but Benson has no idea and heâs happy and in zero pain. He loves to play with stuffy toys, walk in the woods, going to random new places and adventures! Interested in adopting Benson?

1206,Adult,Hound,"Pupdate for 10/20/18

This is Sennyâs foster dad here, and I want to tell you all about Senny and thereâs a lot to say, so hopefully you have a minute to read through!

Senny is a very special dog who is looking for a special family who are willing to give her the love, patience and training she needs to help her overcome her nervousness around people. She has the sweetest disposition but whatever happened in her past we can assume that she was not treated nicely and doesnât realize that humans can help keep her safe and give her all of the love and spoiling she deserves. She shows no aggression toward strangers, but she will tuck her tail and hang very close to her person when she is nervous, checking back in for reassurance when needed. 

Sheâs estimated to be a little more than 1 year old, but no crazy puppy antics from her. She is playful with other dogs but not rambunctious, and is housebroken in her current foster home and of course loves her crate, which is her safe space. If she is overwhelmed or needs a break she will go into her crate to gather her thoughts and then come back out to join the fun! She sleeps in her crate at night quietly and comfortably. 

She just changed foster homes a week ago because we wanted to see how she would manage a transition. Once she has a âpersonâ she is able to attach and use that person to check in and get reassurance, and offer hugs and come over to get some snuggles. She is settling in great and we are taking small adventures (to the pet store, on walks in busier areas, etc) so she has the chance to check out people at a comfortable distance and get closer if she wants to. 

She is making remarkable progress in a short time, especially with the help of two confident dogs who are in the home permanently, one of them who is a senior and the other is a 16 month old puppy. She gets along swimmingly with both. I know that with time and consistent training and opportunities to feel safe she will blossom and thrive. You could not ask for a sweeter dog than Senny. She is a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. 

She is a typical hound (probably coonhound or foxhound is best guess) who loves being outside and following her nose on walks. She is improving her leash manners and walks better with a no-pull harness. She feels more confident when she has a dog buddy walking with her. Because right now she can still be overwhelmed in places with lots of people and noises, she would ideally love to have a fenced yard to explore in addition to leash walks, but she brightens up and gets so excited when she sees and hears you pull out her harness for walks! 

Senny does not have much of a prey drive, which maybe is why she was found as a stray if she didnât do a good job for a hunter. She is currently residing with a 14 year old cat who rules the roost, and if the cat doesnât want to be around and gives a hiss, Senny immediately leaves the situation. She has encountered deer, rabbits, groundhogs and of course birds and squirrels in walks through the neighborhood and is happy to observe them but pretty much just keeps on walking. Of course for any resident animals in the house, slow intro is recommended so she can learn the ropes of her forever digs. 

Senny is a gorgeous hound who is admired by many, but people see how nervous she is and can be looked over because of that. But I know an amazing family is out there who will help her become the best darn hound that she can be. 

Senny has her very own Instagram that chronicles her adventures in foster care and the great progress she is making. If youâd like to check it out, you can find her at www.instagram.com/senny_wise_and_hound_foolish

Her foster (thatâs me!) is happy to answer questions for approved adopters. The other basics for her: she was heartworm positive but completed her treatment with flying colors in August, she is up to date on vaccines, and she is spayed. 

Thanks for reading all the way through! I know there is a wonderful
family out there who sees the same sweetness, gentle spirit and bright future for this shy girl who is learning to trust. I might be biased as her foster, but I believe she is absolutely worth the time and effort it takes to help a dog reach their full potential! As long as she is in foster care we will continue to work with her on overcoming her fears and nervousness. 

8/4/18

Hereâs Senny!  Not sure what happened in Sennyâs past as sheâs not telling Dr. Phil much about it.   We are certain that it would land her on his talk show, if she could talk.  (She canât, sheâs a dog!)  She was designed to be a hunting dog, but she empathizes so much with the hunted that she just couldnât wrap her mind around going after someone smaller than her.  Senny is extremely shy and prefers her crate more than most.  She finds it her safe haven.  She is a beautiful one year old walker hound who weighs 46 lbs.  She has done well with house training, tolerates a leash, but hunkers down flat when her human makes eye contact.  She is gentle and gracious, but she is still trying to trust.  Senny will need a compassionate human who will be patient as she comes out of her shell.  She wants to be loved, she just doesnât realize how much she deserves it.  Senny is fully vetted and has been spayed.  She tested positive for heartworms but is wrapping up her treatment and will be ready to find her new home soon.  If your heart is big enough to love an animal who never knew what love was, Senny is the girl who needs it.  Visit www.wagsrescue.com and complete an application.  Her foster is happy to answer questions for an approved adopter.

Chanel is a people pleaser. She is a very good dog and will make someone a good companion. She likes to run and play and she is quite agile. She practically jumps in a sideways loop when she plays! Chanel has not tried to jump a fence, nor dig. She seems content and easy going.

Excellent companions for any size family with a safe environment in which they can play their hearts out and receive the proper exercise all pups need to be contented and exhausted, rather than bored and into everything.

Upon first meet, Ollie shows himself as a sensitive and shy dog. He doesn't trust all humans right away and I'm sure he has good reasons for that. It doesn't take long for Ollie to get to know a new person though and once he does, he'll show his adorably goofy side! 

Ollie also likes to make sure his bones stay his bones and his food stays his food! Maybe he had to compete for food in his first home before was dropped at a shelter..? Ollie will absolutely tell you not to grab his possessions.. mostly with a high value bone like a bully stick or a meal (usually in his food dispensing tricky treat ball!). Although he loves to share his toys for a good game of fetch and will drop them on command! 

Ollie is a hoot and hilarious when he plays! He will jump for a ball almost 4 feet in the air for his ball or freshly cut grass trimmings! Be sure to check out some of his videos! He bounces around with the ball in his mouth and then he'll drop it right in your hand!!! sometimes he teases a bit and pretends a few times ... hes such a smarty pants!. His temperament is effervescent. He is SUCH a LOVE. After a good game of fetch, Ollie loves to be picked up and held in our arms! He will lounge all day long like that! 

Ollie-Ollie will make you crack up with with all of his adorable antics and hilarious pranks, body contortions, expressions .. ideas & sleeping positions!

She eats, wags her tail, just gets wobbly and unsteady especially when stressed or excited.

Meet Toni! This stunning, 2.5 yr. old, spayed, vaccinated, Mountain Cur/ Staffordshire Terrier mix was saved just in time from a local, N. J. shelter by another local, N. J. rescue. She is now a Rescue Ridge dog! Toni is not just a pretty face! Her brindle fur glistens in the sun, her deep brown eyes tell a tale of sorrow in her previous life but her resilient and loving nature helped her to over
come her past. Now, she awaits your love and her forever home in a kennel in central New Jersey. Toni is a lover, a snuggler, a kisser. She is active one moment and settles down nicely for some quiet time. She loves to play fetch, knows some commands, takes toys, treats, and food gently, enjoys long walks, and would really like an active home that will enjoy playing with her in a fenced in yard and take her for walks or runs. Toni likes to pick her doggie friends so if you have one, letâs do a meet and greet. She seems to prefer the easy going but friendly male dogs so letâs see if you have a good match! Toni is best in a home with older children, we would not want her to knock the little ones down. Oh, donât forget to take Toni along on car rides. She would really like that too! We could go on and on about how wonderful and beautiful Toni is but why donât you see for yourself? Please fill out an adoption application at rescueridge.com. You can text us at 732 546 8805 to let us know that you would like to meet Toni. Here is Toni's latest video:

1236,Adult,Maltese,"Carter is a 9 year old/10 pound Maltese who was surrendered by owners who no longer had time for him, though he'd been with them from puppyhood. 

Carter is very attentive and likes to be with his person as much as possible.  He also gets along well with other dogs - in fact, he is currently living with 4 other Maltese dogs in his foster home.  Carter blends smoothly right into his foster home's dog pack, and is even respectful to the blind, growly, curmudgeonly dog in that group who is not very respectful to him.

Carter LOVES his walks and LOVES running and playing in the yard.  He also LOVES to play with stuffed toys - they are his very favorite thing.  If you ask him where his toy is, he will race off and joyfully bring one back to you - it is so cute!

Carter also LOVES to cuddle, and hopes for a home where cuddling is on the daily activity agenda.

In his foster home, Carter has an adorable habit when his foster mom comes home - he greets her happily at the door, and then races to a footstool and jumps up on it, just sitting and posing.  We don't know why he does this, but it is a consistent habit and it is really endearing.

As cute and appealing as Carter can be, he also has some quirks, probably originating from former abuse.   Carter is head-shy so is not a huge fan of having his harness placed over his head, and he can be afraid of being pet by new people - though this is NOT always the case - at other times he is just fine with new people petting him.  Carter is also a challenge to groom, as he is very fearful of the brush though he is great about taking baths.  Slow, reward-based acclimation to grooming tools will need to be worked on.  Carter does have silky, thick hair, but he doesn't mat easily, so that helps avoid the frequency of needed brushing.

Carter is trained to do his business both outdoors and on a weewee pad, but like many dogs might need re-enforcement when he is uprooted into his forever home.

If you are a dog owner who likes to play and cuddle while helping their dog reach attainable milestones, maybe Carter is the dog for you!  Please submit an adoption application, found on Metropolitan Maltese Rescue's website, and make sure you let us know that you are interested in Carter!

Carter is best homed in a country or suburban setting (he loves to run in the yard!), sans children.  He may work well in a city setting as well, if he has good access to dog parks.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39716091/1/?bust=1537222826', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39716091/2/?bust=1537222827', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39716091/3/?bust=1537222827']",Carter,39716091,M,S,A
1237,Adult,"Poodle, Dachshund","JP is a 5 year old, 15 pound Poodle mixed with Doxie. This is our best guess because if you met JP when we rescued him, there was no way of knowing what breed he was. We usually spare adopters the gory details of the condition of the dogs we rescue, but not to know JP's story would do him a disservice.

JP was grotesquely matted, severely overweight and had a mouth full of rotten teeth. It has taken months of care to get JP to where he is at (both emotionally and physically) today.

A little bit about JP: he has eyes that melt your heart. He's the kindest dog that is so, so grateful. He knows he's been rescued and he is thankful for this second chance at life. JP craves love and attention and will do well with someone who works from home often and has time to shower him with affection. He loves to go everywhere and now walks perfectly on the leash. At first, he had no idea what a leash was. And given his past bout with obesity, he loves food.

JP is fine with other other dogs (big and small) as well as cats. JP likes to sleep part of  the night on the bed and will sometimes jump off to lay down on the floor beside the bed. 

Given that we think JP spent years in a cage while eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom, his one downfall is that he is not housebroken. From time to time he will go on wee wee pads. His foster mom has tried very hard to housebreak him but he has not gotten it down yet. So a home with a yard where JP can learn that the grass is his safe place, would be ideal for him. 

JP is up-to-date on shots, neutered and microchipped.

**It is rare that we know with certainty the ages or mixes that make up our wonderful dogs, but we do our best to be as accurate as possible based upon our many years in rescue.**

Adoption: $325 which covers quarantine, shots, worming, food, medical records, spaying/neutering, microchip,  and an Alabama State Health Certificate.

Transport, if needed :  $120.00    We consider the transport to be of great importance and, as such, take particular care of the dogs during the trip from Alabama.  We  make every effort to arrive with healthy and minimally stressed dogs.

1246,Young,Shih Tzu,"Oreo is 17LBs and does not shed. He has a tiny under-bite which makes him super cute! He is adorable fluffy and also very handsome with a short cut (like he is now). He estimated to be between 2-3 years old. He was surrendered by his owners 10/26 and transferred to foster parents 10/31. He is currently being fostered by Betty: https://www.facebook.com/mushi.lam (please message her with any questions regarding Ores's temperament and personality). As to ""not good with kids"" - that's still to be determined.  

Word from foster mommy: Oreo was surrendered at the shelter due to aggression issues. Since fostering him, I think he is a very sweet and loves to kiss, play and nap. He enjoys walks and his biggest motivator are treats!  Oreo's energy level usually matches mine (active and nonactive), sometimes we just watch TV and other times we'd go for walks and chase birds & squirrels. 

Word from foster daddy: He was understandably nervous when we first met. It took a couple of days for him to warm up to me. But now, we watch TV, take naps and short walks together. Oreo enjoys meeting new people and is friendly with the neighborhood dogs.  

Oreo is neutered and 90% fully vaccinated. He has not completed his full set of booster shots yet. Next set of shot is due in November and the last one in December.

This is the handsome face of a survivor named Bruno! Bruno is a 1.5 year old Pit mix who weighs 45 pounds. This poor boy had been surrendered to a high kill shelter by his owner after having been attacked by another dog.
Because of the severity of the Brunos injuries, he needed to be rescued by the end of the day, or he was to be euthanized. We were not about to let this be Brunoâs fate and we pulled him immediately to safety and got him to our vet partner.
Brunoâs condition was serious...there was a deep hole above his mouth and his poor face full of cuts and wounds. After receiving a bunch of TLC and expert care,
Bruno is healing extremely well and his adorable face is on the mend. He remains a sweet and loving boy despite what he has been through! He is calm and easy going, a well behaved and friendly boy! He would make the best companion...he is so appreciative to be safe and loved. Bruno is great with kids and other dogs and will be neutered and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in his forever home.

1252,Senior,Terrier,"Coco arrived at the shelter May of 2017. She is a 9-year-old lab-mix. She sits quietly inside her kennel, waiting for her daily walks and kisses from volunteers and staff, but she deserves so much more. She deserves a family to dote on her and a place to truly call home. She has energy, loves walks (great on leash!), but is also very content sunbathing and receiving affection from her human friends. She can be selective with her doggie friends (tends to prefer larger dogs) and would prefer a home without cats. Maybe that is why she waits for her furever family? She keeps her kennel clean, is laid-back and is overall a wonderful dog. Coco deserves to truly enjoy her golden years in a home. Would you please open your heart and home to Coco?

Fill out an online application here: http://bit.ly/2D6f5Zy
You must be 24 years of age or older to adopt.

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

All but the white faced one have short little stubby tails and they are all so sweet and friendly. Momma Jenny is a BC mix and just a wonderful young dog. This pup has shorter legs and a rounder face than mom and we think she will be in the 40 to 50 lb range, full grow (but are never sure). Just a wonderful pup in need of a wonderful home. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email!) 
Lovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. 

Our dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! 

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)

Our dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.

Bailey Belle is one of the sweetest, prettiest, courageous, and most loyal dogs you'll ever meet. At 1.5yrs old, she's crate and house trained and knows basic commands. Bailey had a tough start in life and has come along way over the last year in foster, dealing with her anxiety of being left in a swamp. She just needs someone to give her a chance. Bailey's tough exterior hides a heart of gold. She's loving, protective, and playful. Bailey would do best in a home with a large fenced yard and no cats. She's part cattle dog so sometimes she tries to herd but is very obedient when corrected. Because of her herding tendencies, we don't recommend a home with small children. Bailey is good with all the foster dogs that have come through her house, but it takes time to see how awesome she is with other dogs-she needs slow introductions, so she needs a family that is willing to take the time to let her be comfortable. 
Bailey Belle is vetted and vaccinated, including spay. If you'd like to make Bailey Belle a member of your family, please visit our website for an application today www.wagsrescue.org

Note from foster:
Bailey belle is doing a lot better with a large yard to run and play in. My mother's house also has family coming and going and she's doing great. Still wouldn't recommend children under 12 but she's a total love bug. Oh! Definitely a fenced yard bc she loves to run.

Fetch is what she lives to do!!!

Quick Introduction to Petunia

Iâm Petunia â an exuberant flower girl whoâs urgently searching for a foster home and also seeking a forever home. Deep inside, Iâm addicted to love, but I get uneasy when I first meet new people and dogs. Iâm just not the type of girl whoâll jump right into the arms of anyone. I need to take it slow, as I want to make sure these newbies are friendly before I pledge my love to them. I can get scared and bark at first, but weâve found that when yummy treats are part of the program, it makes the getting-to-know-you process smoother. So please be patient with me, and after a while, Iâll flop right on my back, begging ever so sweetly for my favorite thing of all â BELLY RUBS! A close-and-running second to belly rubs are KISSES. Note: Kisses wonât happen as quickly, but donât fret, once Iâve fallen for you, they are required (both giving and receiving) and will be part of the relationship. Abundance of energy, abundance of love, searching for my abundant life.

Petuniaâs Background

I had a family once, and they gave me up â brought me to an inner-city shelter when they found out they were having a baby. I was scared and nervous during this transition, yet remained a sweet girl. I started to bloom again when a volunteer from Rescue Haven Foundation saw my photo and story, and I was brought under the wings of their organization.

Living with Petunia

The recommendation is for me to be in a foster and/or forever home with a dog-savvy person or with someone who is excited to work with one of Rescue Havenâs awesome trainers â this way, my learning can be continued. We feel Iâd do well in home as the only dog. Iâll need regular exercise each day due to my high energy level so hopefully youâll be up for that.

Petuniaâs Forever Home

Have you heard the expression, âWork hard. Play hard.â? My twist on it is âWork hard. Play hard. Love hard.â And thatâs pretty self-explanatory. My foster family will need to continue my training so I can bloom into the bestest Petunia in the garden â thatâs our âworkâ. Weâll need daily âplayâ for exercise and stimulation. And for the greatest gift of all, âloveâ â ours will include belly rubs and kisses, for sure â Iâll just need you to be patient with me as I warm up to new things. If you want some flower power in your life, please fill out a foster application with Rescue Haven, and make a shout out that you âPick Petunia!â

1276,Adult,Terrier,"This Southern Belle has traveled all the way from South Carolina to find her forever home here in New Jersey. When you meet Lady it is obvious that she did at one time have a home where someone taught her the commands that she knows and how to play her favorite game of âfetchâ.

Lady has been in foster since 1/7/18. She has been a perfect houseguest, is completely house and crate trained. She goes right into her crate every morning when I leave for work and is sleeping when I get home. Lady loves her person, loves cuddling and to be pet. She is a calm dog that loves her toys and a good nap on the couch. On walks she doesn't pay attention to other dogs and walks calmly next to them when on pack walks. We do not know much about Ladyâs past, but she does scare easily, so she would do best in a calm household with older, respectful children, and not much traffic in and out of the house. She takes a while to warm up to new people but once she does she loves you. Lady is a very special girl that deserves a loving home of her own. She is silly, full of personality and one the sweetest dogs I've ever had the pleasure of fostering. She is so easy to love and will make a wonderful addition to the right household.

1293,Adult,"Chihuahua, Parson Russell Terrier","I have a Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix who's in need of a good home. Louie. Highly recommended to have a fenced yard. If not, he loves going on trails and being outside. Being a jack Russell, he has a lot of energy, all the time. He could play fetch all day. He loves staring out the windows and going on car rides! He's 10 lbs, brown and white short coat. He gets along well with dogs his size, larger than him are more of a challenge. 

He would be best suited in a home with a single owner. He gets very attached to that person, extremely protective. Can open up to other animals, but not instantly. He does know simple commands (sit, down, jump, come here, go lay down, lets go outside), but he is in need of training. He is not a people person. On walks, he has always shown aggression towards people and other animals. Louie is very loving, but he needs someone willing to REALLY work with him to get him to open up with more people.

I got him from a rescue about 3 years ago, where he was fostered at a home with farm animals. He originally came with the name Louie, so I decided not to change it since he was already 2 years old. With adoption, I will be providing his cage, blanket, and favorite toys and sweaters.

1297,Young,Beagle,"Lovable Lucas is one of our favorite foster dogs. He is Beagle through and through, right down to his beautiful singing voice. One year old, Lucas joined us a few months ago from NYCACC, after his owner surrendered him to an uncertain fate. Owner surrendered dogs often have a tough time losing their cushy homes and adapting to a harsh shelter environment that breeds stress and fear. 

Lucas did not fare well in the shelter. He became unglued and extremely fearful. His behavior deteriorated quickly, and we were asked to step in before he hit the euthanasia list. We were tickled pink to add another Beagle to our chorus. Lucas contributes the falsetto voice that we were missing.

Lucas appears to be a picture perfect Beagle in appearance and demeanor, and has all the classic traits of a tenacious Scent Hound. He has a sinewy, athletic physique, with trademark glorious, floppy ears! He has the classic Beagle low mainenance, tri-color coat, and is at an ideal lean body weight of 26 pounds. Lucas is true to his Beagle Scent Hound roots. He is easy to entertain with a simple leash walk. Lucas loves the outdoors and savors all of the scents that nature has to offer. He needs two to three brisk leash walks a day to engage his mind and meet his energy needs.

Lucas is this an extremely lovable guy, and generally good-natured, unless you're at the vet. He becomes quite testy at the vet, and we opted to muzzle him for precaution. We recommend that adopters choose a Vet experienced with rescue dogs, and that they be prepared to use the muzzle to get in and out without a lot of drama.

Lucas is generally friendly, but can be suspicious of some strangers at first. He quickly warms to gentle human touch. He likes to engage with his people on his own terms, but is more than willing to follow pack rules when it comes to house manners and obedience training. Lucas would be the ideal companion for an active single or couple, who enjoy outdoor activities. We'd like to steer clear of children in Lucas's home since they may not respect his boundaries, when it comes to his food and toys. 

Lucas will bond quickly and love his family, and will want to be the center of attention. If he is relegated to a fenced-in yard or a separate room in an apartment, he will get fussy and bark for attention. Lucas certainly could be alone for an 8 hour work day, as long as he has toys and chewies to amuse himself, but he is not a fan of isolation. When his folks are home he likes to be in the thick of things. He has a vibrant, intense personality, that will thrill Beagle people. He's very typical of the breed.

Lucas loves to play with other dogs, and has been one of the Superstars of our Big Dog play group. He holds his own with a pack of large Coonhounds and random Rottie-Shepherd mixes. Lucas would be a great fit for folks who have another young dog that likes to play. As an older puppy, Lucas did not have the benefit of much obedience work in his former home. He has begun to master the basics, but his adopter should be prepared to provide additional training, discipline and structure, and continue him on the path to Canine Good Citizenship.

Lucas is in excellent health and has been neutered. He has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), He has been boostered as needed. He has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. If you are interested in Lucas, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.

1301,Adult,"Dalmatian, Great Pyrenees","My name is Barrett & I'm 6 years old & a big boy who weighs 95 lbs right now. I am a special boy as I am deaf. My previous owners dropped me off at the shelter and never looked back. It is believed that I lived outside due to the number of fly bites on my ears.

I am quite the gentleman and have great manners. I walk calmly on a leash, I am house trained, and love a good car ride. I get along with dogs. But I do have a tendency to guard my toys & food sometimes. If I need to go out I will let you know by letting out a little whine.

Because I cannot hear, I would be best placed in a home without children as I should not be startled awake when sleeping. Also the doors leading outside should always be closed - if I were to get loose I could not hear you calling my name.

I would love a fenced in yard to play with new my family, humans and canines alike! I haven't stopped smiling since I was given a second chance. I am just loving life! Check out my videos below! EHR feels that I would do best with an experienced dog owner, so if you're looking for that ""special dog"", please check me out! I may have a few ""quirks"", but I will do my best to be a good boy for you!!

This happy brindle boy came to us from our Newark facility as a stray that surprisingly enough, no one ever came looking for.  BoJack is a bit on the thin side, at just 85 lbs., but he's got a huge heart and personality.  He takes instantly to new friends and his ridiculously long tail doesn't stop wagging the entire time he is taking a walk with you.  He's strong, but well behaved on a leash.  He's a bit snatchy with treats, likely because he's been hungry for a while on the streets, but he is well mannered and is a real gentleman.  He's a big leaner when you give him some attention and he doesn't seem to mind other dogs either.  He will make a wonderful addition to a good family that welcomes him home.  File#28587  10/28/18

Itâs his favorite thing to do in the entire universe.  If he canât play fetch, heâll challenge himself to pick up as many tennis balls as he can.  Weâve seen him fit 3 in his mouth at once!  Cola is smart as a whip and has learned how to sit and wait patiently until his volunteer friend throws his ball.  Heâs also fast as the wind.  Heâs back and drops it at your feet before you know it.  After a good game, Cola loves to lie down next to his volunteer and chill. 
Shelter life is hard for an active boy like Cola.  He gets out for about 20 minutes most days , The rest of his time is spent in his run where he waits for his next brief chance of freedom.  Cola would thrive in an environment with an active family or person.  A fenced in yard would be perfect, so he can get his daily exercise.  Kids 12 and up as his size and athleticism would not be ideal around younger children.

Cola will be a fairly low maintenance dog for the person who adopts him. He never seems to bark, he only jumps if you come to his kennel with a leash in hand. He never even react s to his neighbors antics and he takes treats gently. 
At this time, weâve labeled Cola as an only pet, but that could change once heâs out of the stressful shelter environment.  Cola is about 4 years old and 82 pounds.please contact our adoption coordinator, at 201- 981-3215 or email her at

Fospice Care
Hey guys, my name is Pattycakes, but you can call me Patty !!!  I am girl on the smaller side but don't let my under 40 lb stature fool ya - I have the energy of a bigger pointer!
I wasn't properly taken care of in my previous life, in fact I lived my entire life chained outside where I had litter after litter. I didn't get regular vet visits or dental care so I am not as drop dead gorgeous as others but my beauty still shines !     I had pretty bad flea bite dermatitis and a sunburn, as well as heartworms.  I have been treated for heartworms and I'm almost ready for my next stage in life - a FUREVER family. I love snuggling on the couch helping my foster mom watch scary movies, with or without my Kitty friends and my a few of my calm foster Buddies. Because I wasn't treated very nicely in the past and had no way to defend myself against unwanted suiters, I prefer calmer dogs to hyper ones. I love leash walks, and I love Adventures and meeting people. I thought about applying for a position to be a Walmart greeter, but they are open 24 hours and I need my couch time. Do you have room in your heart for a gal who can't wait to be pampered?

We recently discovered that Patty has inoperable cancer and she will be living out her remaining days in one of our foster homes.

1323,Young,"Shepherd, Black Mouth Cur","Sweet Gussie needs a reason to smile. Something tells me she hasnât had a lot of reasons to smile in her life. She was found as a stray on a Texas highway and taken to the local shelter. She melted the hearts of the shelter staff who wanted this girl to have a chance at a better life.

The Black Mouth Cur breed is a âdime a dozenâ in East Texas. Most are used to hunt hogs. As you can see by Gussieâs front leg, she was not a hunter. This is such a wonderful breed! Please take the time to read about them. Gussie is a year old and is very shy initially but warms up easily. She is crate trained and housetrained. She really likes dog toys and has been very happy to lay on her TX foster momâs patio in the warm sun. She resides with older dogs in her TX Foster Home. We feel she would do fine in a home with or without dogs.

She has not been cat tested.

We believe Gussieâs front leg is a birth defect. The veterinarian felt it would be much harder on Gussie to have it removed and she manages very well with it. Gussie weighs 30 lbs and is current on all vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative. She is on a monthly preventative for heartworms/fleas/ticks.

Gussie needs a reason to smile, are you her reason?

This handsome pup was rescued from a high kill shelter in NC and he is now living in a foster home in NJ.  Miller is about 6 -7  months old, about 20-23 pounds and he is very sweet.  Miller has a gorgeous chocolate brown coat, with green eyes and the cuties fluffy ears.

Millerâs foster family saysâ¦..âMiller is super cute!  He is a happy fellow who loves to chase balls, run around the yard and play tug of war with our dog.  He is friendly with everyone one he meets.  Miller understands the commands âsit,â, âgoâ, âlay downâ, ânoâ and comes when you call his name. He walks nicely on the leash and he is house trained, he know to run to the door when he needs to go out. When he wakes up in the morning he charges down the stairs, all 4 legs flying and sometimes falls down 2-3 steps at a time, jumps right back up and runs in a circle, then lets me open the door so he can go out to pee.  Itâs so funny!! Miller also likes following us around and if you pet him, he will just melt.  We love Miller!""

If you are looking for a friendly, fun pup, Miller is for you!

1326,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Diesel is a beautiful full grown 5 year old male pitbull. He belongs to a client who can no longer take care of him. He is a bit of a baby, meaning easily scared, but that makes you love him more. His owner reports that he gets along with various people and other dogs. This boy enjoys his long walks in Prospect Park. Great companion for physically active owners. He is scared of the cats at our clinic so should be fine with them in a home setting. He does have allergies which will require medication and/or investigation.

There is no adoption fee for Diesel, but we are willing to offer low cost neutering if the adopter is interested but not required. Contact us to meet him!

He has been neutered and updated on -shots, is being crate-trained in his foster home and is hoping to find a forever home soon... when you adopt from us you actually are helping 2 dogs- giving a dog a loving home while freeing up foster space for us to help another.

Wouldnât mind traveling around with you in a handbag, but not a great leash walker as she is very timid in loud and unfamiliar environments. Likes dog park time if there are other chis, plays well with other small dogs and could care less about cats. Wouldnât mind being a house dog if you are a stay at home pet parent as she is needy and likes lazy lap and kissy time more than daily walks. Peeped pad trained, but fostered without rugs jic. Would prefer to follow the lead of a city savvy dog, and would languish alone at home so prefer homes with another gentle small dog or a work from home parent. She is a loyal companion for life and will stare lovingly into your eyes until your heart breaks into a million pieces, sooooo sweet. 

Eve's Sanctuary does not have a public location to visit, although we do weekly adoption events in public locations on the UWS. If you are interested in a specific animal, please email info@evessanctuary.com with the name of the animal you are interested in written on the subject line. Please remember that ESAR requires a full complete application, an interview, and a home visit prior to final approval and placement of adopted animals so for faster processing please include a complete application as well. It may seem daunting at first, but to find true love its worth it, right? They aren't products on a shelf to buy, we love them like our own, and only want the best possible home for each and every one...thus the ""hoops."" Also, please trust our recommendations, we are skilled human furry freind matchmakers with many years of experience that has given us a unique and solid perspective. For these reasons we prefer adopters to be in NYC or the immediate area accessible by public transportation so we can work with you individually and educate you face to face!
Additionally, please understand that we are all volunteers, no salaries are paid, we have families and pets of our own, and we have full time jobs in addition to doing rescue work - so we may be (at times) slow-ish to get back to you.

1362,Adult,"Pit Bull Terrier, Mixed Breed","!!! ONLY Available to Love Local Partners with ACCT Philly !!! Harriet - A#40161824 $250 PLEDGED FOR RESCUE CARE! This little lady loves getting pets from EVERYONE - especially back scratches! She walks well on a leash, is perfectly polite on car rides (or just falls asleep...), doesn't jump on on people, and already knows ""sit""! Harriet is genuinely up for any low-key adventure, whether it's strolling along the sidewalk and sniffing the trees or just chilling on the couch. Invite Harriet into your family and she'll make sure you never forget to slow down a bit and enjoy life - and maybe make time for a few extra naps. Intake Type: Stray. Medical Observation: Slightly favoring right hind leg and paw appears to be placed more medially than normal allows extension of hips and knees but very stiff and growling but seems due to behavior and not painful fairly well muscled hind end. Redness on ears/dirty ears. Behavior Observation: Relaxed until leash muzzled for palpation of hind legs but growled when muzzled. Personality: Harriet was easy to get out in the yard, but a little restless once we got out there. She was very environmentally tuned and we gave her space to explore the environment. Eventually she allowed some butt scratches and then we learned -- she really loves butt scratches!!! She got very silly asking for them. She became a little over-aroused at one point and low growled, so we ceased the interaction, but after that she went back to being an easily handled, goofy eyed pup.

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

1375,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Basset Hound","Murray is a 2 year old mix, found on the streets of Texas and set to die.  We couldn't let that happen to this sweet, silly soul who stole us with his handsome stare, and then our hearts with his loyalty and devotion, despite a badly scarred face.

Murray was obviously homeless a long time, his face scarred from countless dog fights, bad weather, no food and no home.   Murray quickly bonded to the hand that fed him and a special relationship was born.  

Murray is looking for someone REALLY special to call his furever human, so it can't just be anyone off the street, you know.  It has to be someone kind and caring, patient, warm and understanding.  Someone who can look past his imperfect face, wiggly butt and powerful tail... and see the most beautiful, devoted soul - I have had the honor of being blessed with.

So, if you think you are good enough for Murray - set up a date !

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

1401,Young,Chihuahua,"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Who could be cuter than Chloe? She is a teeny tiny long haired Chihuahua mix born in Texas in February, 2018. She wasn't born into luxury, but rather anything but and when we took her into rescue her back legs were clearly failing her, her hind end was quite weak. Chloe was having a really difficult time walking and once we were able to transport her to our New York veterinary specialist, we learned that Chloe's spine was literally bent in half. How this happened? We don't know, but we believe physical trauma. Chloe had a CT Scan to see if there were any type of surgery could be performed to repair and straighten the spine but unfortunately there is nothing that can be done. Chloe does quite well and has learned to compensate and is quite mobile. She loves to run and play and just be a playful pup!! She may have special needs but to us, she perfect just the way she is. Chloe is searching for a home of her own with a yard to run and move around in and to get plenty of exercise to keep the mobility she has gained. She needs nothing more than a family to love her and another ""little"" pup or two to run around and play with. Chloe is SO sweet and loving...a little princess who is friendly with everyone she meets! She will be spayed and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in her forever home.

1404,Baby,"Black Labrador Retriever, Pointer","This sweet, southern âBelleâ will melt your heart! 

Belle is a playful, girl with plenty of puppy energy and spunk!  She also has a love of getting into mischief and will need an experienced owner ready and willing to provide her with the proper structure and training to become a well adjusted dog.  Belle will thrive in an active home that can help her burn off some of that mischievous energy both mentally and physically.  And structure, did we mention structure??  We cannot stress how important this will be for Belle.  While Belle is generally happy and playful, she can sometimes demonstrate a bit of a fearful side.  Helping Belle to build her confidence through proper channels (training) and providing her with plenty of opportunities for socialization will also be a key to Belle's success.

If interested in having Belle join you on your next adventure,  consider filling out an application! 

P.S.  After having watched Belle in action a bit, we believe her rambunctious behavior may be a bit too much for smaller children.  She is best placed in a home where all family members can provide her with some consistency and direction.  Children 12+ may be a possibility.

1424,Young,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Harrison-Do blondes really have more fun? If you're Harrison you sure do! 
We have never seen a more brindlelicious babe! He's handsome, playful, loyal, and strong. Just how we like our guys! Harrison was rescued along with two other dogs exactly a year ago from a dilapidated home filled with trash. They were abandoned for almost two weeks with no food or water, and Harrison was chained to a radiator, barely able to even lay down. His housemates have long been adopted, but this guy is still homeless, in boarding, and waiting. 
Harrison is about 3 years old, and he is a very active, energetic dog. He is strong and needs an active home where he can be kept mentally stimulated. He can live with other dogs if he is introduced properly, but it has to be the right dog. Harrison will be best in a home with older teens or adults only, definitely no cats for this blonde beauty. 

Let's share Harrison or as he's known around these parts, Handsome Harry. He needs a foster or adopter, one year is too long for any dog to be without a stable loving home.

1428,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, Pointer","My name is Chloe aka Cloelicious or Mushy Girl.
I'm a 4-year-old female Lab/Pointer/Pit mix whose got a lot of love to give. I love to be loved. I can love on my people 24/7. I was dumped like garbage after giving birth. I was starving and emaciated with sores all over my body. I was terrified at the kill shelter curling myself up in a tiny ball so no one would notice me.
A lovely young college student came to visit the shelter one day and decided to foster me knowing I didn't stand much of a chance of getting out of this  High Risk Kill shelter. She was my last chance. Here's what she has to say about me:

Fast forward 2 months and Chloe is thriving in with her foster mom and is looking for her forever home. Chloe LOVES to cuddle and be around people. She is great with kids. She's friendly and loves to give kisses. Chloe is house trained and knows simple commands. Chloe is working with a trainer to help with her leash skills and  not being reactive to other dogs when she sees them. She is currently working with a trainer to help with some behavior modifications with other dogs. Something happened in Chloe' past that makes her extremely reactive to other dogs. At this time Chloe should be a single dog or go to someone who is  highly experienced and can separate while in training. Chloe is a lovable force of nature. Although she has great energy she also loves to hang out  and watch good movies. Chloe is excellent in the car and loves to Rock Shades while her person is driving. She plays fetch and loves toys. This sweet gal would make a great companion for someone whoâs looking for a dog that gives a lot of affection. Chloe is spayed, vaccinated, dewormed, and flea-treated. Chloe is now approximately 70 lbs of pure love.

1429,Senior,Chinese Crested Dog,"MEET CECE!

This 15 year old beauty queen is named CeCe! She came to City of Elderly Love with a number of other dogs due to their owner's declining health. She's the oldest of the pack but in great health. She's happily settled into her foster home where she is living with other dogs and cats and she's now ready to land her forever home!

CeCe is a sweet, sometimes shy girl who really opens up once she knows she's in good company. She loves to sleep (who doesn't), eat (again, who doesn't), and chew on jerky treats! This gentle girl also loves to cuddle, be pet, and have her luscious mane groomed. CeCe is mostly housebroken and getting better each day with a regular routine. She comes from a home with many other dogs and a cat and is currently living with both large and small dogs and a couple cats. She's likely do well in a home with older, respectful kids. Really, she'd be a great addition to just about any family who will give her a little time to settle in before showing her fun, affectionate personality.

CeCe received a veterinary workup upon coming to the rescue. She has a slight heart murmur that requires no additional care at this time. She has otherwise proved to be a healthy girl!

CeCe is available for adoption through City of Elderly Love. She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. Interested in adopting her? Visit www.cityofelderlylove.org to complete an online adoption questionnaire or email us at info@cityofelderlylove.org!

The family fed him on their front porch, but wouldn't take him inside, as they had other dogs, and didn't want any more dogs. So, Blitz would run around all day, coming back onto their porch for breakfast and dinner. Not the safest situation, and when the neighbor threatened to shoot him, they knew he meant business, so they tied him on the porch. This was in Nov, and as the weather was starting to get cold, this was not the right situation for this dog. My friend texted me and asked if I could take him, so we got Blitz fully vetted, neutered, microchipped and up to NY. He came to us the week before Christmas, hence the name BLITZ, short for Blitzen. Blitz is about 4 yrs old, weighs 30 lbs, is housebroken, and sits on command. He loves adults, children, dogs and cats. He is a very sweet, funny, loving dog that is looking for his forever home.

1453,Adult,English Pointer,"I was found as a stray in Georgia and thanks to PRO made a road trip to Ohio earlier this year to begin my heartworm treatment.  I also was just recently spayed and had a couple benign masses removed. As much as I love it here in my current home, my foster mom says there is a great family or individual out there who will love and keep me forever.
No one is absolutely certain of my age, so let's say I'm a very active younger girl of about 5 or 6 years.  I'm a gal that likes to be on the go. Not to say I won't relax in the house but I prefer to be running or exploring with you. Did I say I like to run? Not marathons, but I have a high prey drive so if I see birds, rabbits or squirrels I get a bit obsessed! 
I am not cat friendly for that reason.
My foster home has other Pointers and we get along great. When a new one arrives for foster, I try and ask them to play. 
I spent a lot of time on crate rest during my treatment and I'm over it! I am okay crated for meals, when my foster mom is away, or it's my bedtime.
Sometimes though if I am not taken outside for long periods when loose in the house, I still will have an occasional accident. I never probably lived in a home before so you just need to be mindful. 
Garnet is a smaller size female, loveable, super silly and seems to socialize easily with people and other dogs. She can be a picky eater preferring canned food over dry kibble.

Her foster mom can answer further questions to approved applicants.

My sister was quickly adopted, but I sat in the shelter for 3 months. I was getting so stressed with all the barking and commotion. I even tried chewing through my kennel door to get out. Finally one day, this guy  stopped by the shelter to see me. I also met his dog. I liked his dog because he was a friendly and nice boy. We played for a bit in the yard.

 Two days later, I met up with this guy again. This time he took me into his rescue. I liked it there because there were kids and other dogs.

 I would really like my own home now. I am not fond of cats or small animals but with proper introduction I do like to play with bigger dogs. I know basic commands, such as sit, and come. Im learning Paw and down.  I love people and love to snuggle. I especially like curling up on someones lap and going to sleep. If you would like to meet me, please fill out an adoption application on www.sammisvoicepbr.com and someone will reach out to you to set up a meet.

1458,Young,American Staffordshire Terrier,": Iâm a sucker for a sad hound dog face, and Shyloâs is near-perfect: handsome and winsome in equal measure. This gorgeous guy could break your heart and make your day with just one look! Iâm the very first stranger that day to walk him at the Care Center, and while shy in his kennel, he gradually relaxes as we stroll along. By the time weâve reach the park, his tail is softly wagging, his fly-away ears are all perked up and heâs ready to leap onto the first bench he sees. A big fan of The Three Pâs (petting, praise and Pupperoni) Shylo is all about settling down and spending some quality quiet time together, and Iâm shocked to see one of the reasons given for his surrender as âtoo strong and hyperâ. Perhaps heâs hiding an energetic puppy somewhere behind his wise old soul exterior, but I suspect the truth is that Shylo just needed more time and attention than his former owner was able to provide. He lived and played gently with a 7 year old and is said to get along well with dogs he meets on the street (as well as in our playgroups), and heâs happy to share his toys, food and space with anyone who cares to join him. Already knowledgeable in sit, stay and come commands, he walks well, seems quite house trained, and weâre told he liked to sleep with his owner and little sibling at nightâcan I get an awwww? No surprise then that sweet Shylo received high praise on his behavior assessment and is recommended for almost any homeâthe more people to love him, the better.

He was very overweight when he came in and it was affecting his legs.  He's been on a diet and has been exercising daily and doing great.  Since the weight is coming off, he has become more active and happier.

He can be protective which comes with the Shepherd and Rottweiler breeds.  We would ideally like to see him in an all adult home with no children or other pets.  He is very affectionate once he gets to know you and will be happy just laying by your feet. 

All of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption.

1472,Young,Mixed Breed,"Felix is a big, handsome boy who is under 2 years old. He is looking for a home where he can be your one and only love. Felix is not sure what to make of the shelter environment and is a bit insecure as he lived in the same home since puppy-hood. Felix was surrendered to us because he was not getting along with the family's other dog. He will do best in his new home with adults that have some large breed experience. He likes being outside and would love a big yard of his own. He will make a great walking companion for an active person or couple. Felix is going to be a loyal companion to someone willing to give him a loving home. Please ask about Felix at the Voorhees Animal Orphanage.

Alice, born in mid-2016, is a stunning Lab mix who loves all people she knows!!
Sweet as sugar.... she will make your heart melt like butter on a hot skillet! This young lady is shy at first but once she has warmed up to you, her little personality just blossoms! High energy at play yet calm and assertive when itâs time to relax and enjoy. She walks well on a leash and loves to ride in the car! She knows her basic commands and listens very well. She is eager to please. Very well mannered and enjoys running errands and loves to go shopping at Loweâs where she has become a favorite!! Everyone falls in love at first sight with Alice ... canât tell if itâs her beautiful big eyes, her gentle nature or simply her loving expressions. She does well with others in the playgroups and prefers dogs with a similar demeanor.
High energy dogs need to go slow but she will warm up in a week or two and be best friends with them.
She enjoys the company of others and is just a pleasure to be with!
Alice really loves to be near her humans and does have some separation anxiety so in her new dream home it would be best if she isnât left alone for long periods of time. She would thrive in a quieter home that doesnât have a lot of people coming and going. She is highly food motivated and loves to learn new tricks. She is dog, cat, rabbit friendly, and completely house trained!

1481,Adult,Rottweiler,"Gracie Lee came to us from a shelter in Long Island, she was very scared in there and would not let anyone go near her except one volunteer named Linda. Linda contacted us by email and begged for Gracie's life. We took a trip to meet her and said this girl does not deserve to die, so yes we took her and Linda drove her out to us. When Gracie got here she was scared, we let her decompress for a day then started working with her, what a lovely girl indeed. Gracie takes some time to warm up but she eventually does and has a heart of gold. She is good with other dogs, we have not tested with cats yet but that can be done if required. We also would suggest older children since they would understand on how to go slow with Gracie Lee. She so deserves a family of her own and she is patiently waiting.

NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

Rainey is a gorgeous Pyrenees senior girl that adores people and loves attention, affection, kind words and gentle pets from her humans. She is so very sweet despite having been so neglected. Rainey came in to rescue from a hoarding situation with multiple neglected dogs. She was part of a large cruelty seizure from neglectful owners and ended up at an already full rural Animal Control. At 8-9 years old, this gorgeous senior girl didn't stand a chance of making it out alive without rescue to help. She is a very sweet girl who adores her people and gets along great with male dogs so she would do great with a male companion. Rainey does terrific with cats as well. She does not need to run any marathons or need a ton of huge walks, but a nice back yard to play in and a comfy bed would keep her very happy! Rainy is a beautiful girl who came into rescue in very tough shape but she is doing great now. She got a wonderful grooming, got her nails done and she is looking gorgeous! Surely there is a caring adopter out there for a mature girl who would absolutely love a home of her own. Where she came from, they did not care for her well at all and she was clearly neglected and starved. Rainy would do well with a tall secure fenced yard, a soft bed to lay on and a male dog for company (she would also do fine on her own).

She acclimated quickly to all the other rescues at Howlin4Spirit's compound. She's happy to learn that life can be better, now that she is wanted and loved. You can see the trust in her eyes, now.

She walks well on-leash, but we have not been able to test her indoors. It is our belief that she was not a dog-lot dog but most likely was an outside dog, allowed to roam. However, as much as she appears to want to please her human, we feel strongly that she is housebroken with a refresher course(e.i., regular visits outdoors and proper exercise).

In just a little over 2 weeks time, her coat has gone from dry & bristly to smooth & soft, with the proper nutrition and medical attention. She looks better and you can tell she's much happier.

Adoption fee: $150(includes spay, micro-chip, all 4-1st yr puppy boosters/2Lepto, 1Bordatella & 1yr Rabies vax, monthly heart worm and flea/tick prevention, parasite-free, health certificate, all medical records from day#1 with H4S CARes including vet's surgical notations, 1/2 gallon bag of current dry food-Tractor Supply Store's '4health'-salmon & potato, beef knee cap bone, 'Rescued Dogs Rock' car magnet, 2 pet alert wallet cards, new nylon Martingale collar and matching 6' leash).

This pup is in and will remain in foster care in Rutherfordton, NC until her fur-ever home is approved. Tess will be ready to go to her fur-ever home on SAT/NOV 3rd.

Transport to all states along the eastern seaboard via Happy Dogs or Lifesavers Rescued Pet Transport svcs.

Transport fee: $125 from western NC to points as far as NYC, and $140 to all points N of NYC as far as Manchester, NH.

1505,Adult,"Hound, Pit Bull Terrier","Woof! Hello! My name is Toby, and I am a six year old hound / pittie mix who weighs just over 75 lbs (I'm a husky boy!). I am friendly, affectionate, silly, and an all-around good boy ... if I do say so myself! :-)

I was recently brought to the shelter after spending over five years in a home. I've adjusted well to my new circumstances and sit quietly in my cage. Don't let that fool you, though ... I am a playful, active, fun-loving boy!

I love to be out and about and walk great on my leash in a harness. I easily pass doggies, runners, and other distractions. I sometimes grab my leash, but I correct easily. I also do a great ""sit"" on command and have a gentle mouth for taking treats.

I love, love, LOVE to play with toys -- ropes, balls, squeakies -- and will happily chase down anything you'd like to throw my way. I can get easily overstimulated, but, again, I respond well to corrections. I'll easily trade my toy for a yummy treat. I'm a good boy!

When I'm excited, I can jump up or get a little nibbly. I don't mean anything bad by this ... I just never got over this silly puppy behavior. For this reason, I would do best in a home with older kids and, of course, adults.

Do you have a doggie at home? I am great with other dogs! I am both playful and submissive with other pups, and I'd absolutely thrive in a multi-dog household. I recently went to a big adoption event and did great being surrounded by other pups. Please bring your doggie along with you when you come to visit me.

One of my human friends said these nice words about me:

""Toby is the best! Through no fault of his own, he's back at the shelter, and he's the same sweetheart he's always been. Toby is absolutely adorable -- no dog has a cuter snaggletooth! -- and he's super social and absolutely loves being around people. He acts like a puppy sometimes, but he's very innocent. He's a fun dog!""

Thank you. And thank you for reading all about me. If you're looking for a playful boy with the best smile around, I'm the dog for you. I can't wait to meet you.!

Love, Toby xoxo

PS ~ I'm also good with cats!

1519,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"AK was brought to the NYACC shelter after his owner and caretaker were arressted.  He was darted by the police and brought to the shelter.  Shortly thereafter, we landed on the Euthanasia List.  His foster mom stepped up to save his life.

His stats:  Approx 4 years old, Neutered.  UTD on vaccinations and Microchipped.

This is what is foster mom says:

AK/Baby is a puppy in a big dog's body.  He hasn't been taught to much in his life, so he needs someone with lots of patience.

He is not a big barker and knows how to push open a door.

We feel he would be ok with larger kids as he jumps and he's a big dog.  He's very food motivated, so training with treats is the way to go with this guy.

If you'd like to meet your next best friend, please don't hesitate with this hunk!

He is ridiculously cute, and he knows it's fashionable to never leave home without a spit bubble hanging from your mouth. Carmine gets along with most dogs but can be selective with his friends.

BellaB is a FABULOUS mix of German shepherd and Rhodesian ridgeback.. super friendly and eager to please, she is an absolute blast to work with! Bella is a big girl weighing in at about 95 lbs.. luckily she naturally never jumps up on you and instead when greeting she loves to sweep in and lean her side into your legs while she looks up lovingly into your eyes.. She has such a soulful, engaging gaze. 

When she first came to us she wasn't exactly leash trained.. she pulled a whole lot and used all of her 95 lbs to pull to where ever it was that she wanted to pull to. After getting some much needed leash training and obedience skills (that she EXCELLED in by the way!!) BellaB is an absolute pleasure to walk. She listens to a number of commands on and off leash.. sit, down, stay, heel, with me, look, leave it, easy, come, paw, walk through the legs trick.. She is SO SMART!! 

BellaB has an extremely calm side to her which surprised us given her excitability outside. When hanging in her kennel she can always been seen sleeping all splayed out on her side.. even during thunder storms or barking commotions she'll be snoozing right through it all! BellaB is a dream for any active household.. she will make a wonderful, loyal and devoted companion!!

1529,Senior,"Jack Russell Terrier, Chihuahua","What a handsome devil! Say hello to Chewy, a sweet, petite, 12-year old, 16-pound Chihuahua/Jack Russell Terrier mix. 

Donât worry - - Chewy wonât be chewing up any of your stuff! As a more mature man, Chewy knows a thing or two about proper behavior. He is fully housebroken, he will go into his crate when directed to do so, he walks like a champ on a leash, and he hardly ever barks. He is extremely bright and obedient, and he knows a whole host of of commands, including sit, wait, come, ok, and crate. 

Chewy is excellent with people and loves being pet. He is a snuggly sort of fellow, and will happily sit on the couch with you while you watch TV or surf the Internet.

It takes a little while for Chewy to warm up to other pooches, so the best situation for this cute little bugger would be a home with another laid back, mellow-ish, respectful dog! 

Chewy enjoys his food, loves all treats, and will never steal food off of the coffee table. At home with his humans, Chewy is pretty much a perfect dog: Calm, cuddly, caring, kind, and oh-so-sweet!

Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (http://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (http://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

He gets along well with the other dogs in boarding and has even done well with the cat. Marshall came to rescue from a very crowded shelter. We do not know what circumstances he came from, but he was really thin and not in great shape, so unfortunately his gorgeous coat had to be shaved down as he was so matted - but no worries, that will all grow back in soon!

Maybe shepherd, maybe lab, maybe part bear?. But here is what we do know about Timber: He loves going for walks, running around the back yard, being brushed (he likes to look his best!), being pet, and relaxing on the deck or porch with his family. He also enjoys treats. And we mean all kinds of treats. He will sit and wait patiently for anything from hot dogs to cantaloupe. There are no bad treats according to Timber. As easy going as he is, he does have some dislikes we should tell you about. He would prefer if his new home was free of hair dryers, blenders, and fireworks. He is willing to compromise and accept more treats however if a home without these things cannot be negotiated.

Timber is housebroken and knows many basic commands such as sit, down, stay, drop it, leave it. Timber would do best in a home with older kids or adults. If you would like to make Timber a part of your family, please contact us to set up a meet!

1545,Adult,Flat-Coated Retriever,"Darling Dory is a beautiful 3 year old 40 lb flat-coated retriever mix with a silky black coat and a gentle disposition.

This sweet girl was neglected and left in a yard at the beginning of her life, so she is initially cautious with new people. She is quickly learning that people are kind and they carry treats! Her fellow foster dog and other dog friends are teaching her a lot about how great people are, so Dory will do best in a home with another dog as a mentor.

Dory is a fun-loving playful girl who has  dog friends of all shapes and sizes. She likes to explore, so would do well in a home with a fenced-in yard. This gentle girl is very clever; she figured out housetraining in just a couple of days, and unlike her namesake from âFinding Nemoâ, she has a great attention span!

After just a few days in her foster home, Dory knew she was in good hands, wagging her tail in excitement to see her foster mom and asking to be petted. Dory is making great progress in learning to trust, and is ready to find an openhearted forever home to settle into.

Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org).  We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org.  Be sure to read about the adoption process (http://www.anewchancear.org/adoption_process.php) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (http://www.anewchancear.org/adoption_application.html)or we won't be able to process it.

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (http://www.anewchancear.org/faq.php) and resources for.  We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs.  Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care.  All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from  private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (http://www.anewchancear.org/donate.php).  It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are  ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance.""  (www.anewchancear.org)

1553,Senior,Pug,"Blind Dog Rescue Alliance will transport within reasonable distance. Sweet Lex is being fostered in York Pa. 

What we know about Lex:
*housebroken
*deaf and blind
*good with dogs
*loves to cuddle!
*diabetic 
*likes to explore the yard

What Lex's foster mom has to say about Lex:
Lex is a super sweet (and cute) 13 year old Pug. He is of the old-style Pugs where he has longer legs and a bit larger. He just loves to cuddle next to someone and be held like a baby. Lex is blind, deaf, and diabetic but it doesn't stop him from enjoying walking around and cuddling on the couch. His diabetes is under control with the help of a good diet and insulin shots 2-times a day, and is very good at taking his shots. He is house broken and will let you know when he needs to go out. He has never been crated in his foster home, instead gated in the kitchen area with his bed and has done great. We are working on getting him used to wearing an Optivizor to protect his face while wondering around. He is doing OK with it.

Lex has attended a few events so far and has not been startled when people come to meet him or when other dogs meet him. He engages with people and other dogs happily. If held in your arms like a baby, he quickly relaxes and goes to sleep. Lex would love to have a home where he can cuddle with you and spend the day dreaming away. 
Blind Dog Rescue Alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41718298/1/?bust=1527210587', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41718298/2/?bust=1527210596', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41718298/3/?bust=1527210604', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41718298/4/?bust=1527210615', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41718298/5/?bust=1529885085']",Lex: adorable older guy!

Miso is one of those dogs who is super sweet and snuggly, without being jumpy, drooly or invasive. Nice!!!

It wonât take much to make this girl happy. All sheâs looking for is kindness, caring and cuddles...plus maybe a prime spot on the couch...and for that, sheâll give you her undying loyalty and eternal love.

Never allowed outside, never allowed to run and play and be a dog. Our rescue was asked to help and we saved 12 precious lives. All of these dogs are now looking for a new beginning and a chance to know what real love is.  We think Gemma is approximately 3 years old and a lab/hound mix, although it is a little tough to age her properly because she was in such poor condition when we rescued her.  Gemma was treated for a skin infection, parasites and heartworm tested.  Because Gemma was not properly socialized and treated as a dog should be, she will require a patient adopter willing to give her the time and the space to adjust. 

Gemma was adopted through our rescue this summer, but needs to find a new home.  Her current owner says that Gemma loves going to work with her at a boarding kennel, and especially loves the older doggy play group.  She also loves going to the dog beach.  Gemma thinks rolling in the dirt and stealing socks are the best thing ever!

Gemma's current owner also tells us that Gemma is dog, cat and older-child friendly, but that she doesn't like to be around a high level of energy.  She would do best in a home with older dogs.  Gemma has never shown any aggression towards cats, but she does chase them.  Gemma likes the children in her current home when they are sitting calmly, but avoids them when they are running around and playing.  Gemma also has a history of snapping and/or growling if a person or another animal touches her when she is sleeping (Beauty Queens need their rest!).  For these reasons, she would do best in a home with adults and older children/teenagers that can be calm around her, and that will understand to not disturb her when she is sleeping.  Gemma's owners feel she would be happier in a home with less commotion than she currently lives with.

Gemma is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $375.

If a dog is listed on Petfinder, he/she is still available. We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the dog. Please keep in mind that we are taking our best guess on breed and age based on the dogs physical appearance.

1565,Young,Golden Retriever,"Enrique is a super loving 3 year old, 35 pound golden retriever mix who came to us from a hoarding case in a very rural area. He didn't have the greatest start to life, but since coming to rescue, his personality is really shining though and he is turning into a wonderful dog.  

Enrique comes across as  a quiet, shy dog, but is as sweet and loving as the day is long.   He definitely needs a quieter home without lots of loud noises.  Definitely people who have bands in their homes need not apply.  Enriques is a perfect gentleman with people, with dogs and cats, but due to his shy nature, he'd prefer a home with kids past the screaming years. A fenced yard is a definite must for our boy.. 

Enrique is housebroken and well-mannered and with a little time and patience, this dog will become the perfect companion for anyone who is looking for a younger dog to be their bestie.

If you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at http: https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. Our main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. All known information about an individual dog is provided in it's listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only ""hold it"" for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break).2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive.All Dogs Require:Supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41857305/1/?bust=1528592548', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41857305/2/?bust=1528592552', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41857305/3/?bust=1528592555']",Enrique,41857305,M,M,A

Minnie is going to make someone very happy! 
This 7 year old sweetheart has a wonderful demeanor and is easygoing and low maintenance. She didnât have much going for herself -  black coat, nondescript older dog who found herself in a kill shelter. Despite that, she hasnât spent one minute feeling sorry for herself.  She thrives in foster care, simply loving life. Her favorite pastime - squirrel patrol and being your sofa companion. At 18 pounds sheâs a perfect small dog size and wonât take up much room in the bed! 
Minnie would love to be an only dog so she can lap up all the attention for herself. She loves people and makes herself comfortable with them. A fenced yard would be perfect for her - we want her to be able to explore her world in safe surroundings. 
Minnie is house trained and crate trained, spayed and up to date with vaccinations. And she has just had a dental cleaning to show off her beautiful smile! Did we say she loves to take walks?  Do you? 
We love rescuing dogs like Minnie. Black dogs are so often overlooked in shelters, and 7 year olds are sometimes thought of as too old. Minnieâs only giveaway is her grey muzzle but she shows no signs of slowing down. She has years of love and companionship to give and sheâs waiting for a family to call her own. 
Please consider opening your heart to an older dog!

1570,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Riely was saved off the NYACC Euthansia List back in August 2018.  He was a stray so much wasn't know about his past.

He is approx. 3 year old Pit bull mix.  Beautiful Brindle and White coat.  He's approx 60 lbs.

He's been in foster home ever since and has come out of his shell and now a really good dog.

He does need slow introductions to new people and other dogs.  He's very protective over his family.

This is what his foster family says about him:

While we have fostered numerous dogs, Riley is the most loving and happy to snuggle dog we have ever come across.  He eyes are truly the window to his soul, and his soul is full of love and trust once he is familiar with you.  Although he is approximately 60lbs, he still likes to pretend he is a âlap dogâ and loves to bury his heavy head in your lap.  He is calm when alone, and after an excited âhelloâ, he will gladly sit and watch hours of television with you.  When outside, he is an excellent leash walker.  He loves to run and play when possible, but will also be happy chewing a bone for a few minutes in the house.  He is house broken, enjoys his meals, and just needs someone to share his love with. There is no doubt; he is ready and willing to be a life-long âbest friendâ!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43259171/1/?bust=1541872717', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43259171/2/?bust=1541872720', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43259171/3/?bust=1541872721', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43259171/4/?bust=1541872722']",Riley,43259171,M,L,A

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. 

Our dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! 

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)

Our dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  
Please, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!

Smart and silly Westley LOVES his toys, and when he's not playing outside he can be found lounging on his bed with a tennis ball or a bone in his mouth.  He's got the hang of the first part of the ""fetch"" game...he's still working on the bringing it back part because he just has so much fun running around after the ball.  Westley loves to chase, and due to his innate prey drive he should not be in a home with cats or other small critters. 

Snuggling is one of his favorite things, but this fit fellow is no couch potato.  Coonhounds and Ridgebacks benefit from mental and physical activity in order to be happy, and Westley is no exception.  He loves hiking where there are plenty of new and exciting smells, and dreams of finding an active forever home who will engage with him and continue to teach him and take him on new adventures...followed by excellent happy snoozes at the feet of his humans. 


Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

Adele is such a smart puppy!
Adele is originally from Shanghai, China. Adele was being trained for police work and she flunked out. Placed in a dog crate in the alley outside the police department she waited for days without food or water to be rescued! Fortunately Shanghai Animal Rescue heard about her plight and they found her, provided the care and safety Adele needed, until she left on her flight to the USA to her new adoptive family and arrived on July 4th.

But poor Adele, her new family loved her, but their cats did NOT ?  Adele enjoyed chasing the poor kitties, and unfortunately terrified them. A trainer was brought in, and Adele tried, but the kitties were just too tempting to chase, and the kitties got too traumatized, so Adeleâs family turned to GSGSR for help.  Adele has traveled halfway around the globe in search of her sanctuary, her forever home. Adele is still a puppy in body and spirit, she loves to play with other dogs, she is housebroken, loves her crate, walks well on a leash, enjoys riding in the car, and LOVES, LOVES to play ball!

Adele is the complete GSD package, beauty, brains, and FUN!
If you have the time and patience to complete training with Adele, you will have an amazing BFF!

I came to Providence Animal Center all the way from Kentucky in the hopes of finding my perfect home and I can tell that it's right around the corner!  I've been spending some time with a wonderful foster family and have shown them just how much of a sweetie I can be!  I may be a little older than the average pup, but that doesn't mean I've run out of love!  I'm a polite and loving boy when I'm around the right people and for me, all people are the right people!  I even get along well with the other dogs in my foster home. When I met a kitty cat at the Adoption Center, they really didn't bother me. I think I could live comfortably with a kitty cat as long as I know the cats are about and they don't sneak up on me!  Like I said, I'm no spring chicken so I like to know what's going on, ya know?  I have a laid-back nature and enjoy time to myself as much as I enjoy hanging out with a loving human friend - I just can't wait to find those loving humans so we can spend forever together!  Although I'm having fun with my foster family, what I want more than anything in the world is to find a family of my own!  Hopefully forever can start today!  If you think I could be your guy, all you need to do is email my foster mom at kmorgan@providenceac.org! She can tell you all about why you need a sweet guy like me in your life! I'll be waiting! Love, Amos""

P.S. One of my new friends is so eager to help me find my forever family that they have sponsored my adoption fee!  That means I can go home with you today for free!  Wahoo!

PLEASE NOTE: You need to attend the OUTDOOR ADOPTION EVENT in order to meet this dog and bring your printed application. Please come to the event should you have any questions or email us at info@koreank9rescue.org. Thank you!
Fill out an online application here: http://bit.ly/2D6f5Zy
You must be 24 years of age or older to adopt.
**If this dog is listed here that means s/he is STILL available**

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING TO THE ADOPTION EVENT:
-a printed copy of your completed online application
-all human residents in your household
We require a completed application, reference check, & home check. An adoption fee applies. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. Due to the volume of emails received we are unable to answer specific questions via email. Thank you!

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

Do not let her intimidate you or discourage you she is just trying to get to know you. Once you spend a couple minutes with her she is the most loving and friendly dog. Once she gets to know you she is very loyal and you will create a strong bond with her. She is on the larger side and for that reason we would not like her to go to a house with small children. She will need a home that can understand her personal space but knows exactly when she wants belly rubs. She has an amazing personailty that will shine through if you take her into our play room. Ginger is around 5 years old and is looking for another chance at a forever home. She has lots of energy and will climb in your lab as she wiggles. Her previous owners say that she is good with other dogs but a meet and greet is always encouraged to insure that she is a good match with your family. She isn't a fan of the vet and has axiety about it but she will grow to learn that the vet is a good place that will keep her healthy. She is already spayed and up-to-date on all of her vaccines. If you think Ginger would be a great addition to your life please do not hesitate to ask any questions or meet with her outside of her kennel.",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41272171/1/?bust=1546010551'],Ginger,41272171,F,M,A

He loves kisses, snuggling and playing- and at 20 lbs he is perfectly snuggle-sized.  He has fun puppy energy but he also likes to laze on a comfy bed in the sun, looking out of a window, watching people, squirrels and birds go by. Stewart loves his toys and likes to carry them from room to room.  He does his business outside and looks forward to walks.  He is an all-around great guy!   


Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible, organization. We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org. Be sure to read about the adoption process (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (http://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/) or we won't be able to process it. We are a foster-based rescue and do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. Please do not contact us requesting a meeting with a dog because we are an all-volunteer organization, and these requests tie up our volunteers who could instead be checking applications. 

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (http://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs. Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care. All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you. We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (http://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance."" (www.anewchancear.org)

1585,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Meet Miss Hikari! This little peanut of a girl was found wandering the streets of Brooklyn and wound up at the shelter. During her stay there, she was described by a volunteer as very sweet, calm, and good on walks. Life on the streets wasn't easy for Hikari. She arrived at the shelter emaciated and missing hair on her back from malnourishment. Hikari became very sick during her stay at the shelter. Fortunately, Ready for Rescue was able to pull her to safety where she was able to receive the medical attention she so desperately needed.

Fast forward to now, where she has put on a few pounds, and has happily settled in to her new foster home. She has a new-found energy and zest for life! She loves going on long  walks with her foster dad. She is very friendly and eager to meet people out on the street.  When she's at home, she's right there willing to snuggle and cuddle with her favorite people.

Hikari is currently working on leash manners when encountering other dogs, since she tends to become excitable when she sees them.  When left home alone, Hikari is quiet and well-behaved,  She is crate trained and is well behaved when her humans are away.

Hikari would love to find her forever home and promises to make a great companion if given the chance!

He has fluffier fur at this point, more like a Border Collie than a Labrador.  He is a shy puppy, but comes to greet the foster caretaker when the crate door opens.  He enjoys play fighting with his siblings (2 other males, 2 females).  He was found as a stray in the South.  His mom, who was only 9 months old, had 8 puppies.  Two died.  They were born in a rocky area where there were copperheads, so it is unknown if they died because the mom left, they were compromised in some basic way, or if a snake bit them.

1589,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Bronson maintains his big smile in spite of saying good bye to his family when they moved and could not keep him. He was clearly loved by his family which included a small child who hugged him very tightly before he went to his kennel in the shelter.  Bronson had some training and will continue to learn new skills at the shelter to help him transition to a new family. For example, he is learning to walk on leash without pulling. 

Bronson loves to chase toys in the yard and to run. He is very excited to cool off on a hot day by flopping into the kiddie pool. Bronson is three years old and weighs about 60 pounds. He lived peacefully with another dog and is house trained.

Although Bronson lived with a small child, the stress of his life at the shelter makes him very excitable when he meets new people and has the opportunity to exercise.  Therefore, we feel that he would be best matched to an adult family or one with older children.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38820370/1/?bust=1527718271', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38820370/2/?bust=1527718271', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38820370/3/?bust=1527718272', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38820370/4/?bust=1501721477', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38820370/5/?bust=1527718272']",Bronson,38820370,M,M,A

1593,Senior,Terrier,"Blind Dog Rescue Alliance will transport within reasonable distance. Marvin is being fostered in PA.

What we know about Marvin:
*smart boy. learns cues easily
*food motivated
*loves toys
*not good with small animals, including cats
*would not be a good candidate for children

This is what Marvin's foster mom has to say about Marvin:
Marvin has shown significant positive changes as he developed trust in his foster mom.  Where he was once fear aggressive, he now realizes that his foster mom may talk in a firm voice to him at times but there is nothing to be fearful of.  This improvement is too significant to capture in words.  
He comes to his foster mom to seek out pets and attention and will follow her from room to room but still does not, and probably never will, like to be held for more than it takes to exchange quick kisses and to receive a few scratches.  He will often come to his foster mom and look up at her, which means, âPet me Momâ.  He will stand on the floor for several minutes enjoying the attention. 
Marvinâs possessiveness when eating and getting treats has also improved significantly.  He waits patiently to get a treat.  He is often last to get his and he is fine with that.  There are several other dogs in the house with Marvin and during mealtime, although he gets very excited and wants to make sure heâs not forgotten about, food can be placed on the floor for other dogs in the house but Marvin does not even show interest in getting into other bowls.  He knows where he eats and will only eat food that is placed in that spot.  Marvin is very protective of chewy treats and toys and needs to be kept away from other dogs when he has one of these.
Marvin has many endearing qualities and is a good potential pet for someone who appreciates truly seeing him for who he is and does not compare him to any other dog.   He shows love in his own way.  It has been an interesting several months with Marvin and itâs wonderful to see him being so trusting, watching him break down the wall of fear that he had for the first several months he was in his foster home.  He has taught his foster mom more than any book ever could about fear, learning to trust and showing love from a distance.  
This little guy is absolutely precious, with a big personality.  If you have an all-adult home, can appreciate uniqueness, have another dog or two who will not get in Marvinâs space, do NOT have other species of pets inside OR outside, then Marvin is the one for you!
His foster mom will speak to you directly to answer any questions you may have about Marvin.   
Blind Dog Rescue Alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39901940/1/?bust=1510587432', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39901940/2/?bust=1510587438', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39901940/3/?bust=1510587448', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39901940/4/?bust=1520700619']",Marvin: on hold,39901940,M,S,A

Hugo also loves to play with his canine friends. He and his companion, possible sister..? Hopey are great friends ..dogs who love people, love dogs and love fun! He never seems to be wary of a new dog or human friend approaching. He just canât wait to say hello and get to playing!

1623,Adult,Bichon Frise,"Please note that all available information regarding this dog is listed here. If you are interested you MUST submit an application prior to contacting us. Inquiries from people who have not previously submitted an application will be discarded. Also, please contact DVBR directly using the following email address:  bichonrescue@gmail.com . Please do not use the links provided on the listing by Petfinder. We do not always see these questions and inquiries. You will have the greatest likelihood of success if you 1) fill out an application on our website, and then 2) contact us at bichonrescue@gmail.com if you have further questions AFTER reading the dog's listing below.

Ollie is a 7 year old neutered male Bichon. He was very recently rescued from an Amish puppy mill in Lancaster Pennsylvania where he spent seven years being used for breeding purposes. Ollie spent those years living in a cage outside with little or no positive human contact. Despite this Ollie is coming around quickly to life as a normal dog in his foster home. He absolutely adores the other dogs that are living here and enjoys cuddle time with his foster mom. Ollie is wearing a belly band while we work on house training and this will be an ongoing process since no attempt whatsoever was made on this during his seven years at the mill. His new family will need to be willing to be extremely patient and continue to use a belly band. Belly bands are very effective tools for this purpose. Ollie has very regular bowel habits and typically goes right after eating in the morning so if we get him outside right after breakfast he typically goes outside and that is not a problem. As is the case with virtually all puppy mill dogs, Ollie's ideal household would include a fenced yard, another small friendly dog to play with, and people who are around a lot and can continue the house training process. In addition a family without very young children would probably be best since Ollie is already unaccustomed to humans and would probably be fearful of the energy level of very young kids. If you think you might be the right home for Ollie complete an application on our website. Once we have it we will contact you via email to discuss the next step. Ollie is such a sweet, loving dog, in spite of what for him was a seven year prison sentence. It's time for him to find a loving home where he can learn what it's like to be a beloved member of a family. Will that family be yours?

DO NOT call the rescue regarding this dog. We do not have the manpower to return the large volume of inquiries we receive anytime a new dog is posted. Our preferred method of communication is email. We check email & return inquiries on a daily basis. We do not return phone calls.  All available information pertaining to this dog is already listed here. NO ONE will be considered as a potential family until they have submitted an application. This is the FIRST step in the adoption process! Pls. note that your application must include a VALID, LEGIBLE e-mail address, otherwise it will be discarded! This would seem like common sense, but the number of invalid email addresses we receive are surprising! Click here to submit our ONLINE application! No mailing or faxing is necessary! electronic application! After an application has been submitted, we will contact your current or previous vet to get a reference. We will also contact you (assuming we believe your home is a good match for one of our dogs) to schedule a home visit. NO ADOPTION IS EVER FINALIZED WITHOUT A HOME VISIT FIRST. This is a required part of the screening process. Our adoption fees are listed at the top of our online application. These fees help to offset the tremendous expenses involved in getting our dogs ready for adoption. Pls. read the top of our application for further info. about our fees. An important note about tie-outs! More & more lately we've noticed a trend toward using tie-outs. Many people believe that tie-outs are a cheap alternative to fencing their yards when they are considering adding a dog to their family. These people also don't have the time to WALK their dogs the four or five times a day they would need to in order to avoid housetraining accidents. We believe that tie-outs are a dangerous method of providing your dog with outdoor time. Bichons and similar breeds are small and would be ""sitting ducks"" for other, more aggressive animals. They also would have no defense against unkind PEOPLE who might pass by... so tie outs are out of the question for these little guys! They need the security of a fenced yard or an owner at the opposite end of their leashes to protect them from the dangers of the outdoors! We hope you will understand that we are only looking out for the safety of our dogs when we say that we have a policy against placing dogs in homes where tie-outs will be utilized.

Fill out an online application here: http://bit.ly/2D6f5Zy
You must be 24 years of age or older to adopt.
**If this dog is listed here that means s/he is STILL available**

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING TO THE ADOPTION EVENT:
-a printed copy of your completed online application
-all human residents in your household
We require a completed application, reference check, & home check. An adoption fee applies. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. Due to the volume of emails received we are unable to answer specific questions via email. Thank you!

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

1625,Young,Mixed Breed,"Dozer, the spotted wonder dog, is a real survivor. Not only did Animal League America rescue him from the ravages of Hurricane Florence, but our top-notch veterinary staff discovered that he was suffering from orthopedic issues and a painful skin condition. He has been making a dramatic recovery here thanks to the generous donors to our Help Me Heal Program. 

Dozer faces one more challenge: he is also deaf. However, nothing can hold this boy back! Dozer has already learned hand signals for basic commands such as âCome,â âSit,â and âDown.â He responds to the âThumbs Upâ signal that means âGood Jobââ he knows that means he receives a tasty treat. This smart American Bulldog/Boxer mix is also beginning to walk nicely on a leash. 

Dozer canât wait to find a home of his own with an experienced adopter while he continues to heal. For a while, his physical activity will need to be limited. We will also be offering six (6) complimentary training sessions at our Port Washington Campus where our Pet Behaviorists will teach Dozer's adopted family how to keep him mentally and physically stimulated, and ease the transition into his new home.

Come visit our Adoption Center in Port Washington, NY, and meet Dozer today or email Ericak@animalleague.org!",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43344482/1/?bust=1545204869'],Dozer,43344482,M,M,A

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

Anna is very gentle and loves to cuddle. I really can't emphasize enough how goofy Anna is, from falling off the couch unexpectedly to running around the backyard in circles by herself. She gets along great with my two dogs and actually really loves my younger dog and they cuddle and play all day. She can also be independent and doesn't mind being by herself. She loves hanging out in the backyard all day and is hard to get in sometimes.

Anna is crate trained as soon as you say Anna crate she walks right in with no trouble. She would need some other basic training but for the most part she goes to the bathroom outside.

Anna's other big thing is water. I have never met a dog who loves water more. I live on a lake and on he weekends the water is really choppy from all the boats but it doesn't stop her - she just loves the water and being dunked under by the waves.

Overall she is a dog with a lot of character and I'm willing to work with any family who would be willing to adopt her. She needs a specific family who likes to exercise and realize her hoarding situation has caused her to have some serious trust issues. I believe she should go to a family with middle to older kids but she has shown no sign of trying to hurt someone.

If you are interested in meeting Ana, go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application. Don't forget to ask for Anna Lizman.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39423577/1/?bust=1505860672', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39423577/2/?bust=1505861871', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39423577/3/?bust=1505862671']",Anna Lizman,39423577,F,M,A
1641,Adult,Terrier,"Say hello to little miss Holly! Holly is a 2.5-year-old Terrier mix who weighs around 24 pounds fully grown. She is the perfect small, fun size! Holly was rescued from Kings Tree, South Carolina. She is very lucky to be alive. In her foster home, she is known as the gentle sweetheart. Holly enjoys playing with other dogs so much and would make the absolute perfect sibling. She is a very balanced dog with a personality mixed with some energy and sweetness. Holly understands how to be independent and will keep herself busy with a nice chew toy while you work on some chores. She is crate trained, primarily housebroken, and walks well on a leash. Holly also gets along with everyone she meets including new humans, children, other dogs, and even cats! She is a wonderful smart little girl who simply cannot wait to find a forever home of her very own.

Holly is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, and microchipped.

She is only 1 year old; about 50 lbs and now fully grown. A unique looking girl, we think her to be a shepherd /lab mix. She came to us a shy little pup but now is self assured and urgently ready for a home of her own. She gets along with most dogs. Crystal is a active dog and would do best in a home with older kids or active adults . She is used to being crated and until a little older should be crated when home alone. We have her crate that you can use. She loves car rides and is very good in the car . She is a licker and gives lots of kisses. She is fully vetted, chipped, spayed and up-to-date on vaccines. Unlike most Shep/labs, she is not a big shedder. She is a clean-looking dog that's low maintenance. We do require you to fill out our application and have good personal and vet references .Crystal must be a indoor dog, with a fenced-in yard.

Want to adopt me? Fill out our online adoption application by visiting our website: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

1648,Senior,Boxer,"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Rock is 8-9 years old. At 45 lbs., he is not a big boy. He was brought to a shelter because he developed a tumor on his leg and his owners wanted him ""disposed"" of. We weren't going to let that happen and we took him into rescue. Rock had to have his leg removed. The tumor was growing rapidly, and the biopsy showed squamous cell cancer. Because it was not taken care of when it first appeared, our vet feels the chances that it spread elsewhere is likely. We know he more than likely needs a hospice home. He gets along with all people and seems to like small dogs. Because he was so emaciated, we can only guess that he had gone without food for a long time, and he now has resource guarding issues - it will take some time for him to adjust to the fact that he no longer has to fight for scraps. He will need to be fed separately and at scheduled feeding times with no free range feeding including treats. It is recommended that he not be placed with children who will hand food or take food from him. Rock is very smart, he learns quickly, and he is a good boy who just needs a loving home to spend however much time he has left in.

5y 38lb Zazu fka Zebracake is a good looking gent, reasonably well groomed and dressed in a lush dark chocolate and black coat. His amber eyes light up his face. His muzzle is very slightly grey, and his mouth opens often into a lovely smile. Zazu is a little shy in his kennel, but gets leashed fairly rapidly. He is a very good walker, marks a little his territory, and eyes the pigeons as well as the squirrels in the park. Well, he is just doing his job, as he is part of the herding group of dogs. Zazu does not mind being stared at by me and the camera. He will sit on command, and is not at all interested in my treats that I thought were quite tasty. He seems to like my caresses all over his body. He is a really very gentle and well-mannered pooch. As we were early visitors at a nearby park, we did not meet many dogs, and those we encountered did not elicit much attention from Zazu.  He is an easy going character, friendly, a little shyâat least inside our wallsâand a lovely Collie/Retriever mix who is sure to attract connoisseurs of the breeds.

She was not eating, had three very large bladder stones the size of golf balls, her eyes were matted shut and had severe dental disease. Perla has had multiple surgeries and has come such a long way in just a few months. 

Perla is a sweetheart and it doesn't take long for you to fall in love with her. At first, Perla can be shy but once she gets to know you she has lots and lots of kisses to give. She has a funny personality; she loves to get her bed just rightâ¦maneuvering multiple blankets (sometimes dragging them from across the room) to get the perfect spot. She loves to be around her family and will follow you from room to room. She will happily sleep with you at night and likes to sit in your lap. Perla loves to spend time outside and is quite happy to lie in sun. She absolutely LOVES belly rubs. If she is lying down, she will roll over for some love the moment she sees you!

Perla would be the perfect companion for someone who is home during the day and can take her outside on a regular schedule. She does have the occasional accident, but will allow you to put a diaper on. She is extremely smart but a little uncoordinated due to limited eyesight and prior injuries. We arenât exactly sure what she has been through, but our goal is to provide a beautiful life for her.

She has been spayed, had a dental and despite losing some teeth, she can eat dry food. She loves treats and will accept anything from dog biscuits to chicken!

Perla is good with cats, dogs and children of all ages. Her foster siblings include two senior cats and an SDHH alum. Perla is our sweet little princess and is ready to become a part of your kingdom! Do you have room in your home for this lovely girl? She would really love to meet you!

Hi there! My name is Ricky! I am about 4 years old and I'm looking to give lots of love to my forever family! I am a very sweet boy who aims to please. I am the friendliest dog out there and never met a stranger -- I greet every person with a wagging tail and a smile on my face! I am silly and have the cutest mannerisms that can make everyone I meet laugh!

I love to go on walks. Being on the move means I get to meet more people--the best! I love walks almost as much as I love my tennis balls. I can frequently be seen carrying around my favorite ball in my mouth. I could play fetch forever...well at least until it's nap time. My foster family says I am quite the cuddle bug and could lay next to you on the couch or snuggled up in bed for hours!I

In my current foster home, I am living with two other dogs and one teenage human sibling. I get along really well with other dogs and would do best in a home with another dog. I like to play with them or relax with them, and Iâm a total gentleman when I meet new dogs. I have never met a cat, but I always like to meet new friends and W.A.R. would be happy to have me meet one! I also could live with younger children who want to play fetch with me!

Want to know even more good news about me? I am crate-trained and fully house trained AND know basic commands! I really like to please my foster family and can't wait to do so with my forever family. My ideal family would have the time and patience to keep up my training and would be super into snuggles!

Everyone tells me how much of a good boy I am. So what do you say? Want to make me yours?

1663,Senior,Beagle,"DOB Jan 30, 2009

Sometimes life just throws us a curve ball we werenât expecting. Such is the case for a wonderful senior beagle named Cleo. Soon to be ten years old, Cleo was happily ensconced in a sweet home where she received as much love as she gave. Then, misfortune fell. Her elderly guardian was no longer able to care for this beloved pet, and so Cleo finds herself at Francisvale in need of a family to love. Just looking into her gentle eyes, there is no doubt that therein beats a heart that would love to love ya, baby. She is the quintessential social creature, loving to talk, connect, and make friends with her human and canine counterparts. Cleo also has an adventurous streak that belies her age and gives her a happy-go-lucky joie de vivre. Doesnât all this sound terrific? Give Cleo the new life she deserves with you, and your life will be enriched too. A win-win for everybody!

Sammy is an easy going and very friendly and gentle adult German Shepherd.  The past year has been tough on Sammy as his prior owner had life threatening medical issues that she needs to take care of, and was desperate to find a home for Sammy.  She reached out to Sedona and we took Sammy into our foster program.

Sammy just loves people, little ones, big ones, medium size ones.  He also loves to chase and play fetch or play with any toy around.  Sammy is a pretty easy going boy.  He walks well on a leash and all you need is to give him a gentle tug if he is pulling too much.

Sammy is trustworthy in a house and can just chill the day away with you or if you want, go out for a nice walk or hang out in the back yard with his family and a jolly ball.  Although Sammy spent some time with dogs when he was younger, he would do best in a home without other animals.

The bad about Max. He needs to be the only pet. He is not good with dogs or cats.  I recommend no young children either. He needs to go to a home that will continue to work with a professional trainer. Max also has resource guarding issues mainly with food/treats. He has nipped but never broke skin. He has also nipped when we have try to make him do things he doesnât want to do like he tried getting in the front seat of the car and I tried to push him back and he tried to nip. So thatâs the 2% of Max that is the bad side of him.

He has potential to be a good dog just needs someone who is willing to exercise him and train him. I think he would do really well with some kind of job.

NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

We are looking for a very special home for Cindy. She is only 2-3 years old but she was so undersocialized as a puppy that she appears frightened of everything. Cindy is so sweet and so deserving of a happy life filled with love and care. She would do best with a confident friendly canine companion who can show her that all new things are not scary but not a home with several animals because she can easily get lost in the crowd and not get the attention she needs. Likewise with people. Cindy would do best in a quiet home without a lot of people or children running in and out. A home with patient, understanding adults who are willing to help her bloom into the dog she was always meant to be. Cindy walks well on a leash and actually seems to prefer to be walked rather than to be loose in a backyard. She is good in a car as well. Initially she picks a spot in the house where she feels safe but as she gets more and more comfortable, she will venture out to be near her humans. We love this shy scared little mouse and we know there is a home waiting for her and hearts ready to love her. If you feel you have that special home, please adopt this girl and give her the life she sodeserves!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39974470/1/?bust=1511298297', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39974470/2/?bust=1511298302', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39974470/3/?bust=1511298308']",Cindy,39974470,F,L,A

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. 

Our dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! 

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)

Our dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  
Please, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!

1687,Senior,"Foxhound, Boxer","Our lovely Mama suffered a tortuous intake process at NYCACC, after her owner repeatedly berated her in the crowded shelter Lobby. Our shelter contact witnessed the verbal tongue-lashing and watched in horror as Mama cowered, and shook spastically throughout the entire intake. As Mama was led into the back kennel area, we were called and ask to help her.

Mama is one of those dogs who just brightens the room whenever she enters. It's amazing that such a lovely creature could be so callously abandoned at the age of ten. Mama is a grand old gal, who needs a happy retirement home to spend her golden years. She had earned stellar behavior evaluations, and was placed in the Shelter adoption program, only to be passed over because of her age. 

Although Mama was a favorite among shelter staff and volunteers, her adoption options were limited. Seems that everybody wants to experience puppy hell, and too few people appreciate the considerable benefits of having an older dog, who is well past the puppy mayhem stage. She came to our rescue so that we could cast a wide net, and find her just the right Adopter. 

Mama appears to be a pretty mix of American Foxhound with a smidge of Boxer that adds some strength to her physique. She is a lean, statuesque beauty at an athletic weight of 45 pounds. Her short, flat coat requires minimal grooming, and Mama enjoys the grooming process. Her coat mostly is white with russet brown patches, and scattered black markings on her face. Mama seems more like the elegant Boxer in personali: she seems laid back, demure, and enjoys the companionship of her people. She exudes happiness and joy.

Mama has a very genial nature. She is a sociable dog, and while she has not had much background in obedience, she has grasped the basics and seems to enjoy the training exercises. Mama is easy to walk on lead, and has a moderate exercise level. She would be happy with a few leisurely to brisk leash walks daily and a game of frisbee.

Mama would be a great choice for a moderately active single or couple, a recent retiree or senior. She could easily do well in an apartment lifestyle, and can be trusted home alone for short periods of time. Mama has excellent pack manners, and would be a great addition to a multi-dog household, perhaps as a companion to a senior dog who has lost his or her housemate. Mama is a pretty good all-around companion dog, and needs to be in an environment where her golden years will be spent as the light of someone's life, rather than considered an afterthought.

Mama has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during his transition to a new home. Mama is in great health and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitus, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus) and has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, microchipped and is on preventatives for Heartworm and Flea/Tick. If you are interested in Mama, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41937331/1/?bust=1529324309', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41937331/2/?bust=1529324312', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41937331/3/?bust=1529324316', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41937331/4/?bust=1529324319', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41937331/5/?bust=1529324322', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41937331/6/?bust=1529324326']",Mama,41937331,F,M,A

And for an older guy, he still has plenty of life in him!

Tucker will do well with another dog in his new home. He is curious about cats and may chase a little bit but means no harm. We think he will do well with children and are recommending a fenced yard.

1691,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Ava is a sensitive lady looking for a kindred spirit with a heart as gentle as hers. Beautiful and demure, Ava takes her time to get to know people and can feel anxious and fearful when in her kennel. But sheâs got a big, playful personality just waiting to shine through her shy exteriorâweâve seen it firsthand. Good things come to those who wait, and if you give Ava some patience and proper introductions, she will show you what a lover she really is.

Big fan of: Her favorite people! Once she has been given the opportunity to warm up, Ava becomes a total lap dog, eager to make new human friends and get plenty of love. Ava would prefer to meet new friends outside of her kennel, where she feels more confident and comfortable. Sometimes, she can get a bit over excited when meeting new friends and forget to keep all four paws on the floor, but our Behavior team is helping her work on this. Ava also loves to play with toys and will zoom around in front of her friends with a toy in her mouth, happy to show off her playful side. When it comes to dog friends, Ava should meet any new dogs first in a one-on-one setting to ensure compatibility.

Special features: Ava is one smart pup! She already knows âsit,â âdown,â and âdrop it.â She will work hard for a tasty treats and is motivated by positive reinforcement training. Ava may be housetrained, but guidance and supervision will help her to remember to only use the bathroom outside in her new home. Our Behavior team can help you with tips to help with this.

Dream home: Ava needs a patient, understanding adopter who has past experience with dogs and who is willing to continue to exercise and train her as she adjusts to a new home. She can join a household with teens and up.

URGENT FOSTER HOME & DONATIONS NEEDED FOR BUCKLEY!

AACSR is pleading for a special long term foster with the biggest of hearts to help our newest NEGLECTED ANGEL, seven-year- old Buckley. When we were contacted to help rehome this poor, sad soul, we of course said yes. The picture the owner presented was far rosier than the reality of Buckley's neglect  and suffering. Buckley's medical issues begin with untreated hypothyroidism, which has left him obese at 46 pounds, such that he is crippled and barely able to walk. Recent x-rays show bilateral ACL tears. He will need to have two orthopedic surgeries  ASAP to repair both hind legs (12 weeks apart). We will never know how long he has suffered in pain with these tears, however degenerative joint disease (DJD)  is already present. The longer he waits, the more quickly the disease will progress and the greater its impact on his mobility will be. His skin reeks of secondary bacterial and yeast infections (also from the hypothyroidism), and is black and thickened like an elephantâs skin across large areas, complete with patches of missing fur. When we rescued Buckley, his nails were also curled like corkscrews into his pads, clearly not clipped since his puppyhood. Emotionally,  this suffering soulâs light has completely gone out. He is despondent, flat, and withdrawn. Somewhere inside, we know that Buckley is still there and can with time come back to us. With love, encouragement, and medical care, we believe he can still become the beautiful boy he was always meant to be. If you can take Buckley into your home for a lengthy period of foster care, please contact us ASAP at rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or complete and return an online application at www.nyabandonedangels.com. As Buckley will shortly be having ACL surgery, he will require a home with no stairs and a fenced in yard.  If you cannot foster but would like to help with a donation towards his medical costs, we would be very grateful. We are not financially prepared for the medical nightmare of Buckleyâs rehabilitation. Please help us to help him!!

Do you love dogs and want to help out a dog in need? Do you live in or close to Warwick?  Could you open your heart and your home to foster a dog? We have many dogs, especially puppies, needing foster homes right now and need your help! We rescue these dogs from high volume shelters that do not expect to be able to successfully adopt them out.  In order to save their lives, we step in, bring them to foster homes in the Warwick area, continue their vet care and puppy training, and find them new homes with loving families.  But while the dogs await their new forever families they need somewhere to call home. All of our dogs are fully vetted and up to date on their shots. Our rescue covers all medical expenses for the dogs, all you need to supply is love, attention, and a warm place for them to sleep. Angels in Waiting Rescue is a small, volunteer-run foster-based rescue.  We don't have an animal shelter--all of our dogs and puppies are placed in short-term foster homes while they await adoption.

1700,Adult,"Whippet, Greyhound","2 Sept 2018: Phillipa (AKA Pippa) is the sweetest, most loving pup. She loves the companionship of humans. She is great with dogs of all sizes and is calm and respectful around new dogs. She has medium energy and loves to cuddle on the couch (and watch reality TV) but also enjoys daily long walks. She loves to play with toys. She is house trained and walks nicely on a leash. She cannot be crated but she is perfect when left alone and does not break or touch anything that doesnât belong to her. Her ideal family is one that can spend a lot of time with her and where she isnât left alone for very long periods of time.

Pippa can be nervous in new situations and this can make her reactions hard to predict. As such, we think she would do best with an experienced adopter who can help her overcome her fears. While she is good with children, given her fear-based reactions, we recommend a home without young children. 

Pippa is a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. She is happy in her foster home, but we know she will thrive in the stability of a forever home.

Once you give this big fella a treat or two ... you then know you have won him over. Hooch will be extremely loyal to who ever adopts him. He's a gentle giant that just wants to be loved.  He is great with most other dogs. Hooch is also great with kids and women; but he needs a slow introduction to men because we feel he had been abused my them in the past. 

Hooch has been waiting patiently for over a year to find a home he can call his own! He is currently approximately 4 years old (as of May 2018).

Our sweet little baby Assana .

Yes she looks adorable ...but fear is in her eyes .

Her owner passed away and clearly he did not care for his dogs . No vetting, no decent food and they don't know what love is .

9 dogs were on the property . We took 5 in and ALL of them are shaking over their body .

Assana bites the first leash over so we put stronger ones and to keep her safe we put 2 on .

She is cornered and surrenders . She lays on her back and I give her slowly some belly rubs... she is confused ...because she likes this .

This poor baby needs a good person who understands what abuse and neglect can do to a dog . She needs somebody with patience and time to give .

We have seen so many blooming open and it's wonderful how adopters and their dogs come together .

It would be nice if somebody can give her her golden basket where she feels safe and loved .

Assana is 3 years old , is ok with other dogs but also a little bit afraid sometimes and is not a fan of cats .

This little beauty is located in Huntington NY .

To become her new family please apply today by filling in the adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one

Gordita came in to the shelter obese and barely able to run, but now she can roll around, run through the adoption center, and sometimes plays fetch! She was diagnosed by our vets as having Cushings disease, but she doesn't let it slow her down at all. She takes pills every day to keep her stable, and is looking for an adopter who can keep up with her medication and continue to help her on her weight loss journey. Because Gordita is choosy about her animal friends, she'll do best in an adult household as the only animal. In exchange she'll repay you in hilarious antics, tons of personality, and adorable pig-like snorts every time she sniffs things!
Name: Ms. Gordita Grande Location: 1810 Grant Avenue (Dog meets are by appointment for approved adopters only.)
Breed: Chihuahua mix (Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label)

Lori arrived from a very crowded shelter in the nick of time and is looking and feeling so much better now that she is safe in rescue getting the love and care that she needs. Lori is very sweet with humans, dogs, and cats alike. When she came into rescue she was completely emaciated and was in such a weak state from parasites and lack of food. But after just a couple of weeks of care she is looking amazing now and becoming a very happy and playful girl! We are so glad to see her looking and feeling so much better. Lori is now ready to find a great furever family of her own.

BIG NEWS! I am ready for ADOPTION!! I have (largely) overcome my fears around feet and am ready to find true love!! I would do great with a single woman or a low key couple who are savvy with rescued dogs. My name (Leo) reflects my big heart, which is about the size of a lipnâs. I love, love, love my people, but sometimes I just need a minute or to have a little space. I am an 8 year old Lhasa/Poodle cross, low shed, fully housebroken, and mellow in the house. I enjoy short walks but nothing too strenuous, as I have a touch of arthritis (a daily dose of glucosamine helps me to feel fit). I am otherwise a healthy boy who is neutered, vaccinated and heartworm negative. Can you give me a home? I have been a perfect boy in foster care and have even enjoyed a road trip (that was fun, I liked the hotel, and being on vacation). Please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com, where you can complete and return an application online. I am waiting to hear from you and am ready to come home!!



UH-OH! Leo is a return to rescue, which of course is a very sad outcome. He was originally placed with a Cocker family, who had no experience with his breed. Our mistake, we are sorry, Leo, you needed a Lhasa family! Leo is a 8 year old Lhasa/Poodle cross who has a Lhasa temperament. Despite a very cute appearance, the Lhasa has  a tough-minded character. Leo of course enjoys a good cuddle (massage of his ears and neck are his favorite), but is definitely not a play thing. When heâs had enough, he wants his space, and his family will need to respect that. Although nimble and also very agile, we believe Leo to have been injured, most likely kicked in his early life, which has slightly affected his gait. He can be cautious and fearful of feet, especially as he has a low stature. We are looking for a Lhasa lover with breed experience to become Leoâs permanent person. While he is currently fostering with a mom and a dad, he clearly does prefer women. We are thinking that a single woman might be best for him (she will soon become his whole world). Please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com to submit an application. Leo has been neutered, microchipped, is current on all shots, and is also heartworm negative. This loving Lhasa is ready to go but he needs a destination. Any Lhasa lovers out there who would like to take him home?",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42067241/1/?bust=1530540829'],Leo,42067241,M,M,A

When he looks at you hoping that you will be kind to him, it will melt your heart. Lenny is trying so hard to trust people and to believe that life can be joyful. When he finally knows you are his friend and you will be gentle and patient with him, he will do anything for you. His beautiful spirit radiates through his fear for the people he loves. The staff at RBARI are very hopeful that in time he will overcome his past and feel safe and happy. Lenny was left outside since he was a puppy, in a junkyard every single moment of his life. When he came to RBARI he only knew suffering and loneliness. It has been a long road for this special dog but the more faith we have in him the more confident he becomes of humans, and of himself. It is truly a wonderful sight to watch Lenny play and run around with a toy in his mouth. Lenny will need a special person to gently guide him along while he learns all the new things in life he has never experienced. It will take multiple visits to give him the opportunity to form a bond with you. He will be a very special companion to his person, completely devoted to making you happy and loving him.

Fill out an online application here: http://bit.ly/2D6f5Zy
You must be 24 years of age or older to adopt.

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

He's presently on the mend in foster care, and would love a new forever home in which to live out his golden years with people who have lots of time for him! Horace doesn't mind most same-sized, polite pups, although he'd prefer a home with older, gentle kids.

NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

SWEETNESS ALERT! Abe is a young Pyr mix (DNA results show 72.8% GP) who is as sweet as he is beautiful. This boy holds perfectly still while he is being petted and loved on because he does not want it to stop :) However, do not think Abe does not have a playful side to him because once he feels comfortable with someone he will bounce and pounce with the best of them. He is particularly fond of belly rubs. Abe loves other dogs but he has not been tested with cats. He walks pretty well on leash with no pulling, with just the occasional stop and sniff or zigzag. Abe is perfect in the house - chewing on anything not specifically given to him has never crossed this dog's mind and he has from the first day in rescue, been perfectly house trained. Abe came into rescue quite thin and was diagnosed with a digestive issue, but is doing well on a prescription diet. This boy appears to have been overly corrected and under socialized because loud voices will scare him. For that reason, we are recommending a quiet, adult-only home for Abe as kids may be a bit too much for him. In such a short time though, Abe has made some miraculous strides toward gaining confidence and trust. Everyone who has been in contact with this boy wants to make everything all better for him and Abe is showing his appreciation by becoming the playful, happy and loving dog he was always meant to be!",['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39031577/1/?bust=1541520968'],Abe,39031577,M,L,A
1721,Adult,"Hound, Pit Bull Terrier","Arf! Hello! My name is Stripes, and I am a four year old pittie / hound mix who weighs around 65 lbs. I am a kind, affectionate, loving gentleman with beautiful manners. I'm also really cute! :-)

I was recently surrendered to the shelter when my owner could no longer properly care for me. I have done a great job of acclimating to shelter life. I can be a tiny bit shy at first, but I really enjoy meeting new people and experiencing new things. My human friends say I melt their hearts. Aww!

I easily share my food and special treats when asked like the good boy I am. I also will drop my beloved ball -- I *love* playing ball! -- for a yummy treat. I have polite manners, so I don't jump up or act silly or anything. I listen really well and walk nicely on my leash, only occasionally tugging. I'm a great doggie!

Guess what else? I love belly rubs! If you want to be my new best friend, just give me a few belly rubs. It's the key to my heart! Hehe!

Thanks for reading all about me! If you're looking for a kind-hearted pooch with a gentle disposition, I'm the fella for you. I hope to meet you soon!

Love, Stripes xoxo

Meet Virginia Rose! Rose is thought to have been with a backyard breeder for most of her young life. She is a very sweet girl, full of pep and energy, who is making good progress on her manners. She gets along with other dogs, is housetrained, and tolerates a crate, though it is not her favorite place to be. She wants to be with people and is very happy to be on someone's lap. She is a people-loving girl but does need a little time to feel comfortable with new people and new situations. Rose's adoption fee is $275.00 and it is preferred that her new home be within 100 miles of central Delaware.
 Update January 2016-- Rose is now recovering from a back episode. She has a wobbly walk, and is having acupuncture treatments to strengthen her legs and back. We are optimistic that she will continue to progress under the care of her holistic veterinarian. Rose will be available to join the right family in the near future. Feel free to email her foster mom with any questions. She has remained sweet even with all she has been through to regain her health, and would love a home and family of her own.

Some people say they could never foster because it would hurt too much to say goodbye.... But it hurts even more to know that a dog or cat died only because it didn't have a foster home to go to. ?
Fostering is an awesome way to help us save lives, and it is a great blessing to the families who open up their homes and hearts to these urgent dogs and cats!   
New Life Animal Rescue covers all expenses for fosters, provides all equipment needed including food, crate, collar, leash, toys, (litter box, litter for kittens / cats), etc., and offers support and training as needed.  
Our foster families just need to provide a safe, loving home until adoption time, and maybe some work like house-training. We help with training tips as we are all about 100% positive, force-free training.   
We also do all the screening of potential adopters, but welcome any input that foster parents would like to offer. We schedule home visits with potential adopters, and foster parents are welcome to come along on those visits if they wish, as they get to know their foster dog best.   
We do limit our foster homes to within one hour of the Marlton NJ area to make the vet visits and other trips easier.

Also because her beautiful coat looks like melted chocolate and vanilla ice cream swirled together. Sundaeâs unique coloring is caused from a cosmetic skin disorder called vitiligo. Vitiligo only affects the pigment of the skin and hair.. causing it to progressively turn white over time. Check out her photos and pigment of her nose... How cool!! She will have ever morphing markings. Even cooler.. Michael Jackson had the condition and so does our dog trainer Jamie!

Sundae seems like a real adventurer and to love the outdoors.. she would make a fabulous jogging or hiking partner! In turn, we have also come to observe that Sundae is a real sucker for a comfy couch! Her crate is located right next to the couch in the living room of the House area. Every time she passes that couch she pops right up and slides her head into the crease while she waits for some good ole belly rubs! Sundae is a real people dog. She LOVES the company of humans and thrives on affection. What a doll Sundae is!!

Iâm also good with kids and I havenât been introduced to cats yet, but my current caretakers think Iâll get along just fine with them. Just like all puppies, Iâm still learning the ropes and need help with my training â Iâm doing well with potty-training by using pee pads and doing great with my leash training, but still working on a few kinks with my manners (what puppy isnât?!). Iâm pretty laidback so crate-training should be an easy learning curve. Iâm a puppy so just remember that Iâll require lot of attention, but I have a lot of love to give and canât wait to find my forever home.

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

1751,Adult,"Shepherd, Mixed Breed","Hello, I'm Lune.  My original name in Thai is ""Lung"" which means uncle.  I was born on the streets of North Thailand, where a mean man on a motorbike ran over my leg when I was a baby, so one of my legs looks a little funny, but I get around just fine.  I play, run, jump, and do everything that normal doggos do. 

I arrived in NYC at the end of September 2018, and now it's almost the middle of December, and still nobody wants me.  I think it's because my leg looks weird, but I wish people didn't judge me for that.  If you come and meet me, you'll see I'm a really nice boy and I love people. I live with a pack of dogs at a sitter right now and I play with them and sleep with them and I get along well with most dogs.  I love my food and treats and to lay on a soft dog bed.  I don't ask for much. 

Won't you come and meet me and see for yourself?  I promise my leg isn't a bad thing...I won't cause you any problems and will be a good boy.  

I can't wait to meet you!  

Lune: 
*35 lbs, 2 years old
*Gets along well with most dogs, needs a couple of days to get used to new ones, but lives in a pack now and all is well.  
*Old fracture in his leg causes him to hold his leg up--since arriving in NYC, he actually uses his leg while playing, as he is growing stronger and doesn't feel the need to hold it up all the time.  It doesn't slow him down AT ALL. 
*Good with cats, children, and all humans. 
*Very affectionate and grateful

1752,Adult,Boxer,"**This is a crosspost for another rescue. Perdido is not located at For the Love of Dogs Rescue. Please contact Nancy 203-249-8998 - nkoury@sbcglobal.net**

?Perdido, or affectionally known as Perdy for short!!  Is a super sweet and active heinz 57.. possibly boxer mix around 2 or 3 years old who absolutely loves swimming and spending time with doggies friends and neighbors! Just look at those eyes... they are so loving and soulful.. wanting for an endearing home to call his own!  Perdy has a beautiful fawn coat with black markings. Don't let his little grey muzzle fool you! Perdy is a young and fresh dog who loves the outdoors. Hikes, long walks or a trip to the pond.. whatever it is Perdy will follow you into any adventure. He craves partnership in both human and canine form!

Perdy has had quite a bit of moving around the past few years .. he was originally sent to a Connecticut shelter from Puerto Rico last year by an older woman who was dying and wanted to assure him a good life. After spending some time in the shelter, Perdy was then adopted by a well meaning family in August 2017. Life happened and the family unfortunately experienced a divorce which greatly changed the dynamic of of the household.

Currently, Perdy is living on a three hundred acre land trust but has been desperately lonely. His owner works long hours, and the children stay there less than ten days a month. Perdy spends hours alone on a tie out, as he has taken to running up the road and waiting quietly outside a neighbors home that has two dogs just to get some company. Perdy so deserves a more active and at home lifestyle with lots of love pouring all around him! The current owner has tried but feels he cannot give Perdy what he needs.

I believe Perdy would do great in a home with other dogs and a family that can really love, claim, and bond with him!
I, Nancy, am helping the owner find a home as I've logged in many hours with this sweet dog over the last year at the land trust. He does great with my dogs and stays with us whenever we are there. He just needs a pack home! We would love to take him but unfortunately our hands are full currently :( 

He's neutered and up on all his vaccinations, healthy with lots of sweet happy energy! I'm praying to find him a happy, forever home-his dying owners wish as well!!!

1755,Adult,"Husky, Alaskan Malamute","Holly is a stunning, 6 year old Husky / Alaskan Malamute mix. This precious girl weighed only 54lbs when she arrived to NY and is now at a healthy weight of 75lbs.

Goofy and loving, it is hard not to instantly fall for this girl. With her amazing looks and thick, soft coat, Holly is just delicious to snuggle with. She ADORES her people and enjoys nothing more than getting and giving plenty of hugs and kisses to those she loves. Nighttime snuggles are Hollyâs absolute favorite, and she climbs onto her foster momâs bed and nuzzles her with her furry sweet face. Once snuggle time is over, Holly is content to hop onto her doggie bed and catch some zzzâs.

Holly is the ultimate walking/hiking companion and enjoys daily walks with her foster mom. This darling is a pleasure to walk and has wonderful leash walking skills. After a walk or hike, there is no better relaxation buddy than Holly, who will get belly rubs for a few minutes and then curl up near her foster mom while she works.

Eager to please, Holly is bright and a very quick learner. She is house trained, and knows âsitâ, âdownâ, âstayâ and how to give high-fives with one or both paws.

Although her foster family has been working on this, and Holly has improved greatly, she doesnât always love to share her toys and food, so she would do best in a home without young children. Holly would also do best with a family where she is the only dog in the home.

Holly was a wonderful mother to her nine beautiful babies, and it is now this girlâs turn to be someoneâs baby. This sweetheart promises to give you as much love as you give her, if not more!




Thank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (www.anewchancear.org).  We are an all volunteer group, so after submitting your application, if you don't hear back from us within a few days, please e-mail us at adoption@anewchancear.org.  Be sure to read about the adoption process (http://www.anewchancear.org/adoption_process.php) on our website, so you'll know what to expect and fill out all fields on the adoption application (http://www.anewchancear.org/adoption_application.html)or we won't be able to process it.

As you can imagine, we are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (http://www.anewchancear.org/faq.php) and resources for.  We do not have a shelter facility and we provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering, and microchipping before transporting our dogs.  Then, we provide whatever follow up care is necessary while they are in foster care.  All of this is very expensive and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from  private foundations or government sources, so if you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (http://www.anewchancear.org/donate.php).  It is only through your kindness and that of supporters like you that we are  ""changing lives...one tail at a time"" by providing our dogs with ""A New Chance.""  (www.anewchancear.org)

Fill out an online application here: http://bit.ly/2D6f5Zy
You must be 24 years of age or older to adopt.
**If this dog is listed here that means s/he is STILL available**

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING TO THE ADOPTION EVENT:
-a printed copy of your completed online application
-all human residents in your household
We require a completed application, reference check, & home check. An adoption fee applies. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. Due to the volume of emails received we are unable to answer specific questions via email. Thank you!

BE ADVISED: Korean K9 Rescue does local adoptions within a 30-mile radius of Brooklyn, New York. Beyond this distance, adoptions are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in advance to confirm if you are eligible/if the specific dog can be adopted outside of radius.

After selecting who we feel is the best fit for the dog, we notify the potential adopter to discuss the next steps for approval. That might be the same evening or in the days that follow the event. Thank you for your support and patience!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.
Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully. Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.

This adorable Pyr mix girl is Angel. She is a sweetheart who loves other dogs, is friendly with kids and her favorite thing to do is play in the kiddie pool with her dog pals! Angel is doing great in her foster home - she is learning housebreaking, and sleeps through the night in her crate. She loves to play, and then take big naps with her new friends. Her other favorite things are to chase squirrels and play 'bitey face' with her foster brother :) Angel walks well on a leash, and enjoys her walks whether with other dogs or by herself.

1768,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"TUNDRA (aka JACKSON, fka KING ARTHUR), 2 years old, 90 lbs, Stroudsburg PA Tundra is available for adoption! Tundra is up to date on shots, neutered and microchipped. If you would like to meet this handsome boy, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414 or amsterdog@gmail.com. You can also fill out our online application to get the process started: http://amsterdog.org/adoptionfoster-application/ Comments from Tundraâs foster mom: Jackson AKA Tundra AKA Houdini. He is about a year old American Bulldog, male, neutered. He is a fantastic dog with very good manners, very good obedience, and walks perfectly on a leash. He is super lovable and very social. He would like to be the only dog in the house. He is a dog that would benefit from being with the person that could take him everywhere with them. He does not like to be left alone and has separation anxiety. We are working on that the best that we can. He loves to play with his toys and loves to go in the car. Basically he will love anything that a person will do with him. ACC volunteer writes: Hear ye, hear ye! You are now in the presence of legend. Not of the sword but of the wholesome heart, and more than worthy to wear the crown. Of course I'd heard the tale of this tail long before I met him. ""A magnificent boy just arrived,"" ""Have you met Mr. Gorgeous yet?"" and, lastly, ""OMG...did you walk King Arthur?"" So, when I spotted a royally adorable face enjoying green grass and sun with a fellow volunteer, instantly I recognized greatness. Now, much like his namesake, our King isn't immediately aware of his power. He is bashful initially, meeting compliments with a duck of the head, and though unable to fight his love for the lap, he hesitates before climbing on. But of course destiny eventually overtakes him and our King's confidence slowly unfolds. Manifesting in ball chases and kisses, happy jumps and silly smiles, and manners that would hold up in Court. King Arthur is still more of a prince at just ca 2 years old, so might do best with an active, experienced, and patient family, one who'll be more than happy to dutifully serve and always remind him of his greatness. ""Hear ye, hear ye!"" You are now in the presence of legend. And if you're very lucky you'll earn a place at his table. Possibly round, and always forever. King Arthur is waiting for you to make him your own!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43251059/1/?bust=1541792622', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43251059/2/?bust=1541792625', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43251059/3/?bust=1541792638', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43251059/4/?bust=1541792639', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43251059/5/?bust=1541792641']",TUNDRA,43251059,M,L,A

Joey is an adorable 2-year old, tri-pod male who is neutered and weighs 16 pounds.

1771,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Roo is a 3 year old Pit Bull mix, full of energy and love. Sheâs curious about everything and loves attention. She is very playful with her sister and absolutely loves giving kisses to any person or dog who wants them. I always joke around saying her ball is her pacifier because she has it with her the majority of the day and can be found sleeping with one in her mouth.

Roo is always looking for love by strangers and dogs when we are walking around the city. Although she loves interacting with dogs outside of the dog park she has no interest in playing with them at the park because of her ball obsession. She also loves sleeping on the bed and loves to cuddle! She loves to curl up and be held at night and is a big fan of covers but sheâs also okay if you leave her on the couch.

Roo has lived with a small Chihuahua as I fostered one for a month and Roo seems to know her size with other dogs. She really wants to interact with cats as well when we pass them in the bodegas in NYC. She even knows which bodegas have them and stops and wags her tail watching and hoping they will one day come say hi. Sheâs good with every person sheâs met and loves kids as well but does try to jump and give kisses when sheâs overly excited.

Roo is NOT with 11th Hour Rescue but we are helping her owner with the rehoming process.

Many of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Sundays and sometimes on Saturdays--please ask by writing us at dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application by Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.

Please consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy.

1780,Adult,"Pit Bull Terrier, Boxer","ERIKA  She is 3 years old  60 pounds  Mixed Breed Female  Spayed

ERIKA found herself at the Brooklyn NYACC as a stray.  Her time was up and she was placed on the euthanisa list.  An amazing person stepped up to save her life and now she's ready to embark on the next phase...adoption!


ERIKA is good with all people and Loves strangers to say hello to her.  She seems to like other big dogs, gets overly excited with small dogs, and wants to chase cats and Squirrels on the Street. Introduction to other dogs should be very slow.
She is housetrained and likes to go for walks about 3-4 times a day.  She pulls some on the leash when she first goes outside until she reaches her spot to relieve herself.   She is not paper trained, and u have never placed her in a crate. 

My wish for ERIKA is to be placed with a fun, Loving, and energetic family that will include her in their daily lives.  She Loves being with her human, and has been great since the second day that I had her.  She Loves sitting beside me and will follow me around my home.  An affectionate and loving family would be ideal as she loves giving and getting hugs, kisses, belly rubs, and having  under her chin rubbed. Patience and observation would be ideal as i believe she has much more to offer, and her past is still unknown.

Erika is extremely smart and knows many commands.  She knows Sit, down, Wait, give me your paw, high five, give me a kiss, and lie down.  She Loves to play ball daily for about 15 -20 minutes. She will retrieve the ball and bring it back to your lap waiting for you to say Drop It.  

Erika can open a door if not closed properly, and also open the refrigerator.  When left alone for too long she helped herself to chicken fingers,  hot dogs, and mozzarella cheese.  She has the most adorable putty face when she thinks she is in trouble.

She does not like loud noises or loud barking dogs.  She is very sensitive to loud noises.

I absolutely Love Erika and wish that I could keep her without hesitation.  I, unfortunately, have loud barking little dogs.

NO SMALL ANIMALS.

Maggie's owner is forced to surrender this sweet gal because her daughter's asthma makes it impossible for her to live with any pets - this is a very sad situation for the family & for Maggie, who they love dearly.

All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application.

He has a striking speckled coat of white and chocolate and weighs about 60 pounds. He loves people and after a walk, jog, swim or hike he would be content to snuggle on the couch. He knows how to play and also likes to show affection. 

He was an absolute champion going through heartworm treatment and the vetâs office fell in love with the big goofball. He has been very tolerant of all vetting. He also is quick to jump in the bath tub and would probably enjoy a soak wherever he can find it. 

He is crate trained, house trained, enjoys the car, and LOVES toys!! Bones, squeak toys, puzzles...you name it he wants to play with it. 
 		
Brando would do best as an only pet and prefers the company of humans. No cats for Brando! His size and energy would be best in a house with older children and adults. He is eager to learn basic obedience with his new family. 

Brando is located in Perkasie, PA. For questions, please contact 		hannah.case@gmail.com 

Brando is up to date on vetting, micro-chipped, and ready to find his family.

1791,Adult,Wire Fox Terrier,"UPDATE 9/2018: At the age of 6, Nancy has recently been diagnosed with glaucoma and she needs eyedrops on a daily basis to help control her condition. We would love for her to be in a foster (or forever) home where her condition could be best managed. Nancy would do best in an adult-only household. She can be a little picky about her doggie friends, but is okay with some dogs. EHR's wish is that someone would take Nancy into their home as foster or forever pup & help her keep what is left of her eyesight.

Nancy is a scruffy little girl with great big ears and a thirst for adventure! She is super easy on leash and loves going for walks and exploring the great outdoors. She takes treats gently and knows some basic commands. But like many terriers, she has a strong personality and would do best with an experienced owner.

Here's what one of her kennel buddies said about Nancy: She got in and rode extremely well in the car. On the walk itself, she was initially so excited to be out that she pulled in different directions, but because she is so light it was very easy to manage. She settled down quickly, however, and was great on the leash for the rest of the walk. She loves to stop and smell everything like a typical terrier but kept the pace and walked well.

Aside from barking at one random couple walking by, she was pretty non-reactive to people and other dogs. When we stopped for our break she took treats well and demonstrated that she knows ""sit"".

1795,Adult,"Boston Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier","Echo is a 4 year old Boston/Pitty mix. Echo is currently located in a foster home in South River N J.Â She is spayed, microchipped, housebroken, & fully vetted. She loves humans & is a great companion.Â  Loves sleeping close to someone on the couch or in bed at night cuddled with her guardian & is always by our side. But she is unpredictable with other dogs. She gets jealous of other dogs & does not control herself in situations that bring on excitement. So she really needs to be the only pet in a home. She also has separation anxiety which means she needs a place where she feels comfortable when left alone. A crate is too confining although she has learned to eat her meals calmly in one & she cannot be left locked in a room by herself. We have found that a large kennel type setting with her own doggie bed works for her. We have one set up in the basement for her when we go out & she is ok with that. We are willing to work with someone in all aspects of her transition who thinks they can give her the home she needs. Having to keep her muzzled all the time while around our other dogs is not what we want for her. A family or person who is home most of the time would be so much more fitting. Someone who understands her needs & is willing to give her the attention she craves would be far better for her.

These pups have shorter legs and rounder faces than mom and we think they will be in the 40 to 50 lb range, full grow (but are never sure). Just wonderful pups in need of wonderful homes. (Fostered in PA) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application.

If you are interested in a specific animal, please email info@evessanctuary.com with the name of the animal you are interested in written on the subject line. Please remember that ESAR requires a full complete application, an interview, and a home visit prior to final approval and placement of adopted animals.

Also, please trust our recommendations, we are skilled human furry freind matchmakers with many years of experience that has given us a unique and solid perspective. For these reasons we prefer adopters to be in NYC or the immediate area accessible by public transportation so we can work with you individually and educate you face to face!
Additionally, please understand that we are all volunteers, no salaries are paid, we have families and pets of our own, and we have full time jobs in addition to doing rescue work - so we may be (at times) slow-ish to get back to you.

1807,Adult,Hound,"These are Daisy and Tommy, both about 8 years old. They have lived with each for about 6 years and love playing together in the house and in the yard. Other dogs sometimes visit them and they all get along fine.

Ideally, they should be adopted together, since they've lived with each other for years, but each could probably get along with any other dog if they were adopted separately.

They know plenty of commands and recently visited the vet, so they are up to date on all inoculations and are spayed and neutered. Daisy is microchipped.

They don't need long walks, so, if you like to just sit at home, they are fine. As long as they have a fenced-in back yard, they are happy. They are glad to wait for you at home while you are at work, too.

They both love rawhide and like to settle down for a good chew after eating their bowls of food.

Daisy is the larger one and is a mix of two Coonhound breeds (Redbone Coonhound and Black-and-Tan Coonhound). She's extremely friendly and loves everyone she meets. She loves food and will counter-surf if the opportunity presents itself. She virtually never barks--just part of her personality.

Tommy is a Treeing Walker Coonhound and loves running in the back yard and barking at whatever he sees, whether it's deer, wild turkeys, or cats walking through the yard.

They'd love to stay where they are, but their owner recently died, so they need new homes. They want to find a new family, because they miss their owner and need some people to love.

When he first arrived at our shelter he was a little nervous, and per the finder he was barking at everything that passed, but stopped barking when commanded by finder. The finder also said that Drago was fine with his new puppy in the car. Drago is super wiggly the second you walk up to his kennel, and is so excited to have someone visit and give him love. He pulls a little when on the leash, but he has been improving since arriving at our shelter. Drago does his business as soon he gets outside, so there is evidence of house training. He is eager to please and is very treat motivated! Drago's absolute favorite thing to do is play fetch, and would thrive in an active home. He is a little jumpy at times, so he would do best in a home without smaller children; he doesn't want to get too excited and accidentally knock them over. Drago is the sweetest baby boy, its unbelievable that he is still at our shelter! Will you give Drago is furever home?

1820,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Sprocket is my name and I am the best boy in the world. I have been patiently waiting for a chance to prove it to my forever family. I have had some pretty rough experiences. These are the parts of my life that I have chosen to forget, but people see them all over my body. Good fortune came my way when Eleventh Hour Rescue saved me from the streets of Jersey City. They cleaned me up and made sure I was fully recovered.

  

 I am easy to take care of with a very short coat that needs occasional brushing mostly because I love it. I don't like to walk very far, but exercise is as important for my mind as it is for my body. I like to walk for about 15 minutes. I am built for comfort not for speed. I like to play with a jolly ball and to spend time outside sniffing around. I love to sit on a bench with a kissable human. I am a little shy with new people and I don't like loud noises. I will let you know I am unhappy about it by heading back indoors.

  

 A greeting from me means hoisting my ""low to the ground"" little body up as close as I can get and giving lots of kisses. When it is time for you to go I will head for my comfy bed and settle in with a toy and a Nylabone to chew. I learned to sleep in my crate, too. I may need a little time to get used to sleeping in a crate again after having a kennel run for a while, but I am a smart boy!

  

 Here are some obedience things I know: sit, down, stay, walking nicely on a leash with very little pulling.

Blanca H Wilson

Ever come across someone that just makes you happier to see them? That is Blanca to Wags Volunteers. This sweet little pittie/lab mix is tiny only 32 pounds at 2 years old. She had a sad life up until she ended up in a rural southern shelter, used for breeding, not the life any dog should suffer through.  Blancas luck changed when Hurricane Florence roared into town, her shelter needed people to take dogs that were housed in outdoor kennels. A local family stepped up to take Blanca and couldnât bare the thought of her returning to the shelter. Wags agreed with them and Blancas life changed forever.  This sweet girl is happy and playful. She doesnât care whether it is playing and loving on her foster mama or playing tug of war with her foster brother she is ready to enjoy life.  She constantly entertains her family with her zest for life, and interest in all things new (she even thinks her new friend roomba is great, although she is not sure why it doesnât want to play). Blanca is crate trained and house trained and has learned that a leash means going somewhere fun with her foster family.  Blanca has been heartworm treated and is ready for a family of her own, please contact her friends at Wags for more information.

Heartworm treated 

Must meet bully breed criteria 

Blanca is vetted and vaccinated as age 
appropriate, including spay, and available for adoption through Wags Rescue and Referral.

I will follow you all around and take nice walks with you. I've had a few litters of puppies but I got spayed about a month ago. I know how to sit, lay down, give paw, wait and go outside.

From my foster:
Mixxie is a four-year old spayed girl from NYC Animal Care and Control. Her owner had to move into housing where they do not allow pets. I am currently fostering Mixxie in hopes that she will find her forever home. 

She is very people-centered and loves being near them. Mixxie would do best as an only dog at this time since she gets very excited with some dogs. I have one female dog she doesn't care about, but a hyper male dog that gets her very worked up.She feels the need to jump on them, therefore she is rated best right now as an only dog. She listens incredibly well and knows to go out to go the bathroom, lay, sit, shake... You can tell her to go in her crate and she will. She is a bit of a baby because she'd rather stay next to me than go into her crate. Mixxie walks nicely on a leash and her does her business on our walks. You can tell Mixxie has had some puppy litters but is now spayed. She is up-to-date on all her shots.

If you would like to meet Mixxie, please contact me, Susan at suzen451@yahoo.com or call or text me at (845) 657-9639. She is fostered near Kingston NY and her rescue group is Imagine Pet Rescue. imaginepetrescue.org

Once you have decided that Mixxie is a good fit, you will be asked to submit an application for adoption through Imagine Pet Rescue. 

Here are some comments from NYC: 
Gentle, loving, and beyond sweet, MIXXY has waited for a family to pick her. She looks up with her copper eyes full of hope as you pass her kennel, pleading in silence and patience for a walk, a touch, a hug. She adores flopping down at your feet, rolling on her side for belly rubs, then sprawling across your lap for cuddle. Will you toss her a lifeline now?

A volunteer writes: Mixxy is an absolute little mush! She's shy at first, but if you allow her to go at her own pace, she'll reveal her super-sweet, loving, gentle personality. When I approached her cage, she took a minute to come up to the door and did so in a submissive posture. Once outside, I crouched down and let her approach me as I spoke in a soft, friendly tone. She soon came up to me with her tail wagging, and I started to pet her. Within seconds, she was walking into my arms as if she wanted to be hugged. She continued leaning into me while slowly turning and lowering her body. I couldn't figure out what she was doing - that is, until she had wiggled herself onto the ground and placed herself in full belly-rub position! And oh my goodness, what utter delight she took in having her tummy rubbed; there she layed - on her back, with eyes half-closed, a big doggie smile, and body and mind in a blissful trance! It just melted my heart. Throughout our walk, Mixxy was happy and very responsive. Every time I stopped to pet her, she did her little belly-rub dance - knowing full well that I could never say no. When she got up, she rewarded me with lots of cuddles and kisses. It wasn't surprising to read that Mixxy's previous owner said she loves to be around people and would even follow family members around the house. She also knows commands such as ""sit"" and ""give paw."" Mixxy loves treats and playing with balls and Kong toys, and walks nicely on a leash. If you'd like to meet this little sweetheart, please come down the Brooklyn ACC shelter where she's awaiting her forever home....just be prepared to have your heartstrings tugged.

MIXXY, ID# 42831, @ 4 Yrs., 57 lbs.
Brooklyn Acc, Large Mixed Breed, White / Brown Brindle, Unaltered Female

I came into the shelter as a owner surrender on 29-Sep-2018, with the surrender reason stated as person circumstance- moving - no pets allowed.

Basic Information:: Mixxy is a 4 year old altered female Medium mix breed. She was given as a gift when she was a puppy. She appears healthy but does get ear infections and has allergies to grain food. She was surrendered due to owners moving to a place that doesn't accept pets.

Previously lived with:: 3 Adults and one toddler

How is this dog around strangers?: Around strangers Mixxy will bark at first but when adapt to them and become friendly. She is outgoing towards everyone in the household.

How is this dog around children?: Around the 2 year old in the home she is relax and playful.

How is this dog around other dogs?: Mixxy lived with a male dog her breed and she was playful and tolerant around him. Also with other dogs outdoors she is social.

How is this dog around cats?: Mixxy will bark and chase cats she sees in the backyard or on walks.

Resource guarding:: Mixxy does not resource guard her food toys and treats. If you try to take them away from her she will play bow or play tug.

Bite history:: Mixxy has never bitten or scratched anyone owner stated.

Housetrained:: Yes

Other Notes:: Mixxy isn't bothered when being restrained or being pulled off furniture. She runs away when she knows the water is on in the tub to take baths, however when in tub she is tolerant. She rather take baths outdoors in the yard with waterholes. She will bark when unfamiliar people approaches the house or family member. Mixxy will bark and whine in one spot when there's thunder storms or fireworks.

Has this dog ever had any medical issues?: Yes
Medical Notes: She appears healthy but does get ear infections and has allergies to grain food.

For a New Family to Know: Mixxy is trained to use the bathroom outdoors in the yard and if she goes on walks she will pull a bit on the leash. She eats dry food grain free twice a day. She loves to play with balls and kongs. Mixxy loves to be around people so she will follow owners around the house or be in the same room.She knows commands such as sit and give paw. Mixxy used to be crate trained when she was a puppy. Owner describes Mixxy as friendly, affectionate, playful, confident, pushy, independent, and anxious.

Behavior Assessment
Date of intake:: 9/29/2018

Spay/Neuter status:: yes

Means of surrender (length of time in previous home):: Owner surrender

Energy level/descriptors:: Mixxy is described as friendly, affectionate, playful, confident, pushy, excitable, independent, and anxious.

Summary:: Mixxy came into the assessment room nervous, she was timid and fearful towards the handlers with a slow approach. After some time she warms up to new people.

Summary (1):: According to Mixxy's previous owner, Mixxy is social around other dogs. Here at the Care Centers, Mixxy initially is nervous and avoident. After several sessions, Mixxy is slightly more confident and engages in social interactions. The Behavior Department recommends that Mixxy be placed in a home with resident dogs that are respectful and matches her calm demeanor.

10/2: When off leash at the Care Centers, Mixxy is avoident and spends the bulk of her session to herself. She is nervous around the novel male and quickly moves to another pen when he enters.

10/3: Mixxy is a bit more social today, briefly greeting the novel female dog then moving away to explore the yard. She checks in with her a few times, each time becoming a bit taller in her posture.

10/4-5: Mixxy was respectful and social with a novel male dog. She checks in with him, while exploring the yard.

Date of intake:: 9/29/2018

Summary:: Upon intake Mixxy was loose body and sat and gave paw for treats

Date of initial:: 10/1/2018

ENERGY LEVEL:: Mixxy displays a low to medium activity level in the care center.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION:: ADULT ONLY HOME

Behavior Asilomar: TM - Treatable-Manageable

Recommendations:: No children (under 13)

Recommendations comments:: No children: Due to how uncomfortable Mixxy is currently with touch and novel stimuli, we feel that an adult-only home would be most beneficial at this time.

Potential challenges: : Fearful

Potential challenges comments:: Fearful: Mixxy is timid with new people. She manages her stress well and has not escalated or shown any aggression, but she does need time to warm up to new people. She does best with a slow approach, and should be permitted to greet new people at her own pace and to initiate interaction (rather than being approached and pet immediately by a new person) so she has time to adjust and become comfortable before she is handled. She should be spoken to softly and gently.

1839,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Pit Bull Terrier","Mink is a wonderful companion and just wants to please.  

Mink and two other small dogs were living in a car with their owner, who fell on hard times.   Mink needed eye surgery to correct a very painful condition where her eyelashes curled into her eyes and restricted her vision.  

She was taken in by Delco Dawgs, surgery was performed leaving Mink pain free and with normal vision!  She was so happy to see again!!

Mink loves people, belly rubs, is not a chewer, and loves to give kisses.  

Mink is strong and would do best in a home with no children, as she may knock them down by accident.  Someone experienced with larger dogs who enjoys the outdoors would be a great fit.

Mink would probably do best as an only pet, since she has been an only dog through her recovery and foster.  Mink could play with other dogs, with a proper introduction, as she did live with other dogs in the past when very young.  She will chase cats and squirrels. 

Mink is a beautiful color with red highlights and is so loving.   She deserves a good home where she can feel the love of her very own family!!

1840,Senior,Chinese Crested Dog,"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.A-59Let's give a gentle hello to this sweet and timid boy Albie. Albie is one of the Texas-13 and his first 8 years he had little or no contact with humans, so he is leery of humans. Albie has no aggression, and he prefers his solitary life outside or in his crate. Albie is a watcher from afar. His foster mom is working on socializing him.
Albie has come a long way from his first days in foster care.
1. Albie was a little wild and needed a harness and 6 foot leash so he could be caught and brought in to the house. Today Albie's crate is open and he has free range to the house and dog door. Albie is housebroken going in the yard. Albie does not like leash walking so a fenced in yard is needed for this little man.
2. Albie eats well we have gone from feeding him outside, then inside the dog door to family room. Today Albie is eating in the kitchen with the other dogs. Any noise and Albie runs for his crate, but he is getting better at this.
3. Albie does not know any commands. This is a challenge since he will only takes treats in his crate. You must place the treat down then walk away and he will eat it.
4. Albie will come out of his crate for Albie time. His foster mom started getting him out of his crate for snuggle time, brushing and general human time. Albie resisted at first but now he will come out of his crate on his own to be picked up for couch time. Albie has been taken to bed to sleep with his foster mom and other dogs and he is sleeping all night in the bed.
If you are interested in adopting he is a work in progress. He is learning that having a family is a good thing. But you must earn his trust.
Albie is being fostered in Wilmington, DE. He's up-to-date on all his shots, he's neutered, and microchipped. He's ready for his happily ever after. Applications are welcome, but please remember he is a work in progress.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43465246/1/?bust=1544370801', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43465246/2/?bust=1544370805', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43465246/3/?bust=1544370807']",Albie,43465246,M,S,A

1842,Adult,Australian Shepherd,"Speckles is a five-year old, female, black tri Aussie. She weighed 36 pounds when first rescued, but has since put on some much-needed weight, and is currently working to put on a couple more pounds.

Speckles is very affectionate and loves people who she has had time to get to know, though she can be a little shy at first. She seems to pick one person to be especially attached to. She is very good with other dogs and loves a good play session with other dogs to help burn off some energy. She's still learning her boundaries, and when to stop bothering the other dogs in her foster home when they've had enough, which is understandable since it's all new to her. She has also caught on pretty quickly that the cats she shares her foster home with are the ones truly in charge!

Speckles doesn't seem to really enjoy car rides so far, but she tolerates them well enough. She walks well on leash but tends to constantly wrap around behind you to make sure everyone is following along. Speckles still needs to learn her basic commands, and has a tendency to try to counter surf when given the opportunity. She is house broken, but needs to be allowed to go out as soon as she is released from her crate/being separated in another room or she may pee in the house (we suspect her routine was to be let out of her crate/enclosure right to where she would go to the bathroom so that's just what she knows). 

?Speckles is relatively high energy when she wants to play and is only now beginning to figure out how to play with dog toys, but she does have an off switch and will settle right in with the other dogs in her foster home after she spends some time pacing around/looking for more food. She would do best in an active home, with a fenced yard â the bigger the better, but she seems to make do with the small yard in her foster home. She would love to be in a home with other dogs but would do fine with frequent play dates with other friendly dogs since it's her people that she cares about the most. 

Speckles is fostered in Haddon Township, NJ.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43464594/1/?bust=1544046470', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43464594/2/?bust=1544046472', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43464594/3/?bust=1545181238']",Speckles,43464594,F,M,A

1844,Baby,Australian Cattle Dog / Blue Heeler,"PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE SECTION! ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE BEING FOSTERED IN NORTH MISSISSIPPI. They will be transported north after adoption process is complete and dogs/puppies are ready for travel. We currently adopt to NY, NJ, NH, CT, PA, MD, VA. 


This litter of puppies was born to a momma dog who has at least two litters a year on the road where one of our volunteers lives....She had to drive by them every day, and three days in a row she saw one hit and killed in the road. Finally, she stopped at the house and asked the owner if she could have the puppies. He agreed. He also agreed to let Project Paws spay the momma dog, as he wanted to keep her but said he couldn't afford to have her fixed. 

We took in the pups and never, ever, ever, in all our years of rescue, have we seen pups so covered in FLEAS. We treated them and a couple of hours later, you could literally sweep the fleas into an appreciable pile. Our vet said that in another day, the pups would have been so anemic from fleas and worms they likely would have died. But. Now they are all healthy and happy and NO FLEAS! They are all spayed and neutered and as sassy and cute as they can be! We just adore these babies! They are all ready for their new families, never to be mistreated again. Help them bust out of Mississippi and get on to a better life!

Please send an email to projectpawstippah@gmail.com for an application. We will respond within 24 hours. If you haven't received it, please check your spam folder. Our adoption fee is $450.00 is includes all age appropriate vetting, (puppy vaccines, rabies vaccine if old enough, spay/neuter, microchip, flea/tick/heartworm preventative, wormed) transport to city listed and health certificate.

Joey is good with some (mostly) female dogs but can be reactive to other dogs when he is on a leash. He is a high energy boy who needs a confident person and a home that can provide guidance and structure in a loving manner as he is also a very affectionate boy.Joey has a condition called Steroid Responsive Meningitis (not transmittable to other animals or to humans). This means that at least for the time being and possibly long term, Joey requires daily medication and special attention to his medical needs.Shelter life is very stressful for Joey which negatively contributes to his condition. A foster or forever home could very well be ""just what the doctor ordered"" and might actually help him get into remission!

This pretty girl is Maddie, who was found as a stray in in Manhattan.  Her finder told the shelter staff that she brought Maddie into her house for a few days in the hopes that she would find her family, but even though she hung posters and reached out to neighbors, no one claimed her. The finder had a three-year old son who Maddie adored, but sadly, no pets were allowed in their apartment, so they couldnât keep her.

Maddie is very loving, gentle and snuggly.  She is two years old, so she still has puppy energy to burn, but she has no problem relaxing after a long walk or playing in the yard with the other dogs in her foster home.  She loves other dogs, and in her foster home she frolics and plays with two smaller dogs and one bigger dog and gets along with them all.  She runs like a goofy deer, sometimes in leaps and bounds and sometimes tripping over her own feet.  She knows how to sit, and she is very smart, so teaching her new commands or tricks will be easy. 

Maddie is such a happy girl!  She loves playing with all kinds of toys and chewing on bones.  She is not a picky eater, and although she is about 50 pounds now, she is all muscle and when she fills out she will be even more beautiful.  Maddie sleeps with foster mom under the covers to keep herself (and her foster mom) warm.  She loves to snuggle, and if you let her she will lick your entire face.   She has stunning hazel eyes, and the speckles on her ears enhance the âPeteyâ patch on her left eye.  She is gorgeous!

Maddie is about two years old, and we think she is a Pitbull/American Bulldog mix.  She would love a home with another dog but would also be fine without a canine sibling.   She loves kids and adults alike and would be an excellent family dog.  She is very playful, but not hyper (she enjoys her down time as much as playing).  She is housebroken, spayed, up to date on all her shots, microchipped, heartworm negative, and crate trained.  She has two old scars on her back which you can see in some of her pictures, and they have healed nicely but her fur may never grow back in those areas.  She is one of the best and most loving dogs her foster family has ever met!

HI - my name is Belize.  I sure have had a rough start in life.  I found myself homeless, living on the streets.  Unfortunately, being a young pup, I did not know the dangers of the road.  I ended up hit by a car.  Lucky for me I was found by a kind person who got help for me.  I had a broken leg which was repaired and is in the process of healing.
I am still young and am working on my manners.  An experienced dog lover, who will put time into training me will really help me a lot.  I do have a lot of energy so an active person who can give me a lot of exercise as well as a fenced yard would be great.  Also, I can be scared of new situations and new people, as I am still learning to trust.  Therefore a home without children would be best - a  quieter household without too much activity inside the home would be great!
My foster mom says I am a super smart girl and that to know me is to love me.  If you desire a true companion and you have the patience to teach me to be the best that I can be, I may be your girl!
Please call Susan if you would like to meet me!  267-312-3372

1853,Young,"Terrier, Hound","Bliss is living with 3 other dogs and she loves playing with them however she can be a bit protective when sharing people and food around them. We suggest a home with a very easy going dog or not dogs. She can play with them but living and sharing is not her best skill. She is very sweet and intelligent and loves being outdoors.
Bliss would do better with older kids, she is not aggressive and we just believe that she is  bit too jumpy for smaller size kids.
Bliss got along with one of our cats but it really depends on the cat ability around dogs. She is a fast learner, a super well house trained dog and a real beauty with great marks on her coat.

I was surrendered by my owners due to a pet conflict. I'm a sweet sassy girl and just full of SUGAR and SUNSHINE!  I bring smiles to everyone's face that meet me young and old. People can't believe my age and I just tell them I'm 10 yrs young and I've got great healthy genes and I'll be here for a while! I'm the perfect dog to go on leisurely walks or medium hikes or to hang out on the couch or lay by the fireplace. I do need to keep my rubenesque figure in check as I love to eat so daily exercise is a must. I am civil to dogs in passing, but in the home I'm a bit of an attention hound and must be the center of attention so that's why I need to be a SOLO DOG.  I'm not sure about cats. I'm fine with kids. I'm a lovely lovely GEM of a DOG! I need someone who will make me the ""Apple of Their Eye"" for the rest of my golden years and I will repay them with unlimited snuggles, licks and kisses.

1860,Baby,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Catahoula Leopard Dog","Moose is a young and silly pupper - only about 9 months old. He has lots of playful energy and he's a Catahoula mix - needless to say we would really like to encourage active adopters with a big yard. 

We got Moose back in early August as a death row rescue with a very very bad virus. He spent a lot of time in the hospital and then quite some time in a quiet medical foster home. Since we've had him for several months, he has had a chance to live in a few different homes. From that, we have learned that he would do best in a home with another well-adjusted dog to help show him the ropes and give him companionship. We also do not think he will do well in a home where he is left by himself a lot. Moose has been working on his crate anxiety with a professional trainer. We hope that his adopter can continue to provide him stability, comfort, and training. If you can't stand to cuteness of this face and want to show this dog the good life, send us your app today!

1863,Adult,English Shepherd,"Mia is a 4 year old, 46-pound English shepherd mix. She was alleged to be a Rottweiler mix, but I am here to inform the world that a black dog with brown spots above its eyes does not mean the dog is a rottie.  So not rottie here. 

Mia is a very timid, sweet dog who practices sad looks to get more treats. She is a quiet girl, but she is all about the snuggle time. This is a dog that would like to be near you, with you, and occasionally, on you. She is easy going and friendly and she does well with all people past the screaming years (think 8 and up). Mia is also good with dogs and cats and she has good indoor manners.

Mia needs a laid back home with people who understand that shy dogs need time to blossom. This dog is never going to want to go with you to the ballpark to meet throngs of people, but she is going to be your sofa companion extraordinaire. She won't even judge you if you watch ten straight hours of America's Got Talent. Mia needs a home with a fenced yard and a dog companion to show her the ropes. 

If you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at http: https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ and then email erika@bigfluffydogs.com. 

Our main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. All known information about an individual dog is provided in it's listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only ""hold it"" for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break).2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive.All Dogs Require:Supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there.","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42774304/1/?bust=1537114472', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42774304/2/?bust=1537114481', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42774304/3/?bust=1537114487', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42774304/4/?bust=1538402869', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42774304/5/?bust=1538402870', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42774304/6/?bust=1538402973']",Mia,42774304,F,M,A

1877,Adult,American Hairless Terrier,"SAANA is a very sweet 10 yr. old female American Hairless Terrier. She weighs just 9 lbs. Because her owner has become unable to care for her due to illness and work, Saana needs a new home as soon as possible. Saana loves to spend time with her family and becomes sad if she is left alone for long periods of time. Sheâs a real snuggle bug who loves to be held. Her favorite place is on your lap. When not on a lap, you can find Saana under a blanket or in front of the fireplace. During the summer, Saana likes to go on short walks in the park. Her paws are very soft and she needs booties on the sidewalk. During cold weather, she wears her down coat in order to keep warm. She has a shirt or 
pajamas on in the house.

Saana has some allergies, so she needs a special diet. Saana loves to eat fruits and vegetables. Her favorites are carrots, celery, cabbage, apples, and blueberries. She will also eat fish, eggs, and liver. As much as she is thrilled with her food, she never touches anything else around the house and never chews or destroys things. Saana prefers to go potty outside, but has gotten used to a pad at home. Now that she is older, she will get up during the night to go potty on her pad. She is very accurate and only goes in the pad area. 

Saana is very quiet unless she hears dogs barking outside or someone knocking at the door. She has lived in a condo her entire life and has done well. She will bark at visitors when they first come in. But after a while, she becomes used to them and settles down. Saana loves going for rides in the car and can sit in the front seat or in a soft sided crate in the back. 

Saana's right knee has a luxating patella. If she takes her inexpensive
supplements, she walks perfectly fine and there is no sign of any problems. The vet said she may need a surgery in the future, but she has done great and with care this should not become an issue. 

Saana is UTD on routine shots, spayed, and walks nicely on a leash. She will do best in a home without other animals.

*** THIS IS A COURTESY POST. SAANA IS NOT IN AMERICAN FOX TERRIER RESCUE. SHE IS LIVING WITH HER FAMILY IN MA. ***
 






ADOPTED!

1878,Young,"Mixed Breed, Chihuahua","Hazel is a 12-13 pound, 1-year old mix with a bit of Chihuahua in her, maybe. She was found as a stray in Los Angeles and was very scared. Our LA partner rescued her and found her to be playful and curious - she loves her toys and fetches, but plays well on her own too. She is weewee pad trained and will go outside. She is very shy at first so go slowly, but it does not take long (with the aid of a few treats) for her to warm up. She loves people and will want to be in the same room. We did not try crating her as she is new to us. She loves cuddles and tummy rubs! 

She is microchipped and will be spayed as part of adoption.

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

Say hello to this gorgeous purebred Great Pyrenees boy, Ripken. Just turned 1 year old in November, Ripken is one of the friendliest, most lovable pups around. This big boy loves everyone, and if he can play every minute of the day, he probably would! Being young, despite his size, Ripken likes to chase his tail, which he can't quite seem to catch :) Ripken loves rolling around on his back, and truly enjoys getting his long, silky soft coat brushed to perfection. This smart pup already knows sit, lay down, and even come. With a family who is dedicated to his training, there is no doubt Ripken will mature into a pyrfect gentleman. We believe Ripken would thrive in a home with another playful sibling, preferably a big yard to run around, and most important of all, one where he can get as many belly rubs as he possibly can. Look no further, Pyr lovers, this big, fluffy goofball is bound to bring you endless joy and happiness!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43505942/1/?bust=1544469655', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43505942/2/?bust=1544469660', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43505942/3/?bust=1544469668']",Ripken in NJ - pending,43505942,M,XL,A

They are 3-month-old Boston Terrier/Shepherd mixes. Some of this litter look more on the Boston Terrier side whereas others resemble Shepherds. These pups are as sweet as they come. They enjoy playing with each other, chewing on squeaky toys 3 times their size, and running around in their fosters backyard. They are working super hard on becoming house, leash, and crate trained. They are all getting better and better day by day. This wonderful group of puppies cannot wait to find individual forever families of their very own. 

The River Litter is spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and microchipped.

Entirely unresponsive when assessor solicits attention. Overwhelmed and declining in kennel environment. Personality: Meet Smiley! Smiley was found as a stray and brought to the shelter. Smiley is scared of her new, loud environment. When we visited her, she was resting in her kennel. She took treats from us nicely and began to warm up. Once outside of the shelter, her tail was out and wagging and she walked with minimal pulling on the leash. When we got to the dog run, she took time to explore. After a while she came over for some attention. She was definitely more interested in treats, but she didn't mind some pets. When we got back to the shelter, she was tense and nervous again. Smiley needs someone who can give her time to warm up and decompress outside of the shelter. If you can help Smiley, please reach out to Lifesaving!

1894,Young,Shar-Pei,"Onyx is a 2 year old shar pei that would love a great home of her own.  She came to us with a family of shar peis from our Newark facility when their owner could no longer care for them.  It's a good thing that Onyx was turned in, as she was suffering with severe entropion in both eyes, and had a skin infection.  We sent her for surgery to correct her eyes and she's all cleaned up now and healthy, and she looks and feels like a brand new pup!  Onyx has an air of aloofness about her, but please don't overlook her because of it.  She only needs a few minutes to check you out, then she'll be playing with you, leaning against you for attention, and jumping in circles with happiness when you toss a toy for her.  She is very well mannered, housebroken, and polite.  She gets along with some dogs, but needs time to get to know them.  She will need a home with older kids.  Onyx is such a darling that would be ecstatic to be welcomed into your family.  File#28446  8/24/18

Providence Animal Center is funded solely by adoption fees and donations. Adoption fees vary per animal, please call the Adoption Center and reference this animal's ID number in order to obtain accurate fee information. The petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed blend for our dogs. We have chosen âMixed Breedâ as this predominant breed for our dogs. Around 75% of dogs in shelters are mixed breed dogs, meaning they have many different genes that make up their personality, the way they look and everything in between. Here at Providence Animal Center, weâve made the decision that we no longer want to speculate the dogâs breed. Why? Because visual breed identification has been proven to be extremely inaccurate. What we can tell you is the dogâs weight, approximate age and his or her personality traits. Many progressive shelters like ours are moving toward not adding a breed label â in an effort to be honest and transparent. To read more about our initiative to treat each dog as an individual, please read our note on our website: http://www.providenceac.org/removing-breed-labels-homeless-pets/

To foster or adopt this dog please call Providence Animal Center at 610-566-1370 during adoption hours. You may also email adoptions@providenceac.org. Can't foster or adopt? Donate to help our homeless pets, www.providenceac.org/donate.

Our adoption requirements and a printable application form may be found on our website. With your adoption fee you get a lot for FREE! All the pets adopted from Providence Animal Center are given wellness exams, are spayed/neutered, fully vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped. Additionally, dogs over 7 months old are heartworm tested and all felines are tested for FELV/FIV. Adopters may receive discounted wellness care from our adoptions health department, and also get a complimentary wellness visit at a participating private veterinary practice up to 30 days post-adoption and the pets are given personality evaluations. It doesn't stop there- a gift of one month of pet health insurance is included along with unlimited phone consultations and e-mail exchanges with our trained feline and canine behavior experts.

Not ready to adopt yet? You can still guarantee the safety and well-being of any of our dogs or puppies by temporarily fostering one or more right in your own home. Visit our foster page to learn about the program. Then, email your application along with any questions to foster@providenceac.org for immediate review.

Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application.

1937,Senior,Pit Bull Terrier,"Brooklyn is an awesome, goofy girl! She is extremely friendly and affectionate. Brooklyn likes to walk and sometimes even looks like she is skipping. She pulls some on the leash and is still strong for her age. Brooklyn loves balls, especially balls that squeak and she likes to walk around with them in her mouth. She knows ""sit"" and is eager to please. Brooklyn is looking for a home without small children, but older children should be fine. Brooklyn is 8 years old and was surrendered because her owner was moving and the new landlord would not allow dogs.

Our adoption fee is $60 per pet with a discount available for adopting two animals together. All animals from the Franklin Township Animal Shelter are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and up-to-date on all age-appropriate shots prior to adoption. Dogs have also been tested for heartworm.

This is TITAN.. a handsome 6/7 yr M Tan/White Amstaff/Mastiff X. He's 70 lbs of PURE HUNK O' LOVE. He's a sugar sweet big boy and loves all humans and wonderful with kids. He's good with large calm dogs but not good with small dogs and cats. Unfortunately an incident occurred where a neighbors small dog got in Titan's face barking  aggressively and Titan grabbed it and due to the extent of the injury, it did not make it. As a result due to the city ordinances, Titan had to leave the area or be euthanized. It's unfortunate and tragic what happened and no one ever wants a pet to die but accidents happen and what's even more tragic is that another dog will lose it's life for nothing more than being a dog! Still, Titan is an AMAZINGLY SWEET LOVING BOY - and he deserves a second chance!!! PLS HELP this WUGGIE WOO see another day and live his life to the fullest!!

1941,Young,"Hound, American Staffordshire Terrier","Age: 9 months
Weight: 40 lbs
Hello! Iâm Sasha. Iâm an adolescent girl who thinks just about anything is fun! At first glance, people will notice what a slim girl I am. Iâm naturally skinny with long legs. Iâm still looking to learn some new tricks and people to meet. I will do best in a home with no other dogs.

Here is what Animal Havenâs trainer has to say about me: 

Sasha is a young, playful, active and affectionate girl.  She loves people and is very snuggly once she is properly exercised.  She would do best in an experienced, adult-only household as the only animal.  She is very easy to motivate and train, and with structure and consistency does quite well in a home.  She can be selective with dogs, which makes walking her a full-focus activity (no texting and walking!).  We have been training her to lessen her reactivity and sheâs made progress but will need someone who is committed to continuing her training plan and helping manage her environment on walks to help keep her feeling safe.  She would also benefit from someone who is very active â if youâre looking for a jogging partner, Sasha is your girl!  She loves to play tug and fetch and has learned âdrop itâ on command.  She also benefits greatly from daily mental enrichment, such as puzzle food toys, to keep her occupied and work her brain.  Donât worry â weâll give you plenty of trainer support and help with all these things.  In return, she will be an adventurous companion and people will stop you on the street to compliment how stunning and unique she is!

He loves to swim, hike, run and do anything his human is doing.  He is a fantastic cuddler who loves to snuggle up on the couch and cuddle up with you at night.  He prefers to be the only dog in his new home, however.  He has found that he really doesn't like sharing his people or his things with other canines.  It's just not his thing.  He does get along well with cats in his foster home, though he does play a little rough sometimes.  He is good with farm animals as well and is especially fond of the goats.  We recommend him in a home with older children since he has not lived with children as of yet.  If you are an outgoing, fun loving, outdoorsy, adventurous soul then Declan is the guy for you!

Declan is up to date on all of his vaccines, and has been neutered and microchipped and is on flea/tick/HW preventative.  His adoption fee is $325.

(breeds were recently changed/updated) She was brought to an overcrowded, New Jersey shelter as a stray and Rescue Ridge stepped up to save her. Belle is affectionate, playful, loves to snuggle, and is housebroken. Belle has played with several other dogs and has walked well with them, too. She lived with a small dog and with a young child. She likes most dogs and we would need to see if your dog is a good match. Belle has helped some of the dogs at the rescue adjust to kennel life, including the timid ones. She is a loving, beautiful soul who has been dealt a rough deck and wants a person or family to love her forever. She takes toys, treats, and food gently and is very sweet. Belle walks nicely on a harness and weighs about 60 lbs. Belle would do best in an adult home or one with older children. She would also love a fenced in yard. Come see Belle and apply to adopt her at RescueRidge.com and then you can also text us at 732- 546- 8805 to meet Belle.

1970,Adult,Labrador Retriever,"Jackie Davis Lonestar is a very beautiful, sweet-natured girl. She loves other dogs and is great with cats as well. She is a gentle soul who was rescued from euthanasia at an East Texas shelter shortly before her puppies were born. She was a great momma, and all of her ""Veggie Garden"" babies have been adopted. Jackie enjoys being indoors and outdoors. She loves to run and play outside with her doggie friends. Jackie had a significant hip injury when she was rescued (probably from being hit by a car), and she required an expensive hip surgery. It hasn't slowed her down at all--she still enjoys playing with other dogs and going for walks. She can be trusted to stay out in the house when her foster mom isn't home. She is house trained, and she is crate trained (although she really doesn't need one). Jackie is a special young dog hoping for a wonderful family to share her life with. Her foster mom describes her as ""a treasure wrapped in fur""! Jackie will be ready for adoption in January 2019!

1996,Young,"Akbash, Great Pyrenees","NYS Registered Rescue # RR102
NGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
NGPR does not adopt dogs to homes with children under 6 years old.
Previous dog experience is required, preferably large breed.

Female Great Pyrenees rarely cohabitate with other females successfully.  Our goal is for each adoption to be a permanent placement, therefore homes that already have a female dog are not eligible to adopt a female Pyr.

Clara is a beautiful, young, female Pyr/Akbash mix that likes to be busy ALL the time :) She would love to have kids to chase and play with (preferably bigger kids) or someone to run with. Clara also loves walks, car rides and toys...LOTS of toys! She is doing very well with her leash training - although anxious to get started, she begins with a very fast walk but will ease up when told (she knows the word 'no'). Clara loves to enthusiastically greet people so her foster has been working with her to not jump and she has greatly improved. Clara is a very smart girl that learns very quickly...she can open storm doors and will be happy to let herself out :) She goes and comes through the doggie door and goes to bed at night when told ""it is bedtime"". Clara does well with other dogs when properly/slowly introduced (she does not like a dog to come running toward her as she will get defensive). She can be protective of her treats with other dogs, so they are best to be given separately. Clara does well in the house, but if she can't go in and out on her own, she is happy if she can at least see outside, and have toys to play with. This sweet girl seeks approval and love from her people, and will give lots of love back in return!","['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41216950/1/?bust=1536339200', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41216950/2/?bust=1536339200', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41216950/3/?bust=1536339200']",Clara,41216950,F,XL,A

He is 2 years old and 50 lbs and while he looks like a Shepard mix, the trainer who took him in and has worked with him for the past 5 months, saw his parents to be the Lab and Heeler. He is professionally trained and was not socialized and knew nothing, when he got to the trainers home several months ago. He is now more social and so well trained and LOVES other dogs and cats. He can be nervous in new situations, but again, warms up so very quickly. He is amazing and will make a great family dog. He loves kids.

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. 

Our dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! 

Lovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)

Our dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  
Please, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!

1999,Adult,"Chesapeake Bay Retriever, American Staffordshire Terrier","Wonka came to the shelter as a stray a year ago. He was scared, skinny, and neglected. His Chesapeake retriever red coat now shines and he is a healthy 60 pounds.

 Wonka is a favorite of all who care for him because he is so affectionate and eager to learn new things. He has learned to walk nicely on the leash and play politely in the yard. He relaxes easily in a crate which facilitates the transition from shelter life to a home. When visiting the home of volunteers, he is calm, good with the children, very well mannered and appears to be house trained.  He is an excellent passenger in the car and falls asleep (big snores!!) almost immediately at the start of any excursion.

He would do well in an adult household or one with older kids. He enjoys the company of other dogs in playgroups at the shelter, but would probably do best as an only pet at the outset when transitioning from the shelter to a home.
