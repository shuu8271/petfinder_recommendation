1,Young,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Cattle Dog","HOW IS THIS FANTASTIC DOG GROWING UP HOMELESS? A true Southern Gentleman, CALVIN is living hi sbest life with an awesome foster famliy in Pottstwon, PA, which inlcudes four other dogs he loves!  CALVIN has responded beautifully to training, consistency and structure, returning the favor with obedience, loyalty and love! It's not fair for CALVIN to be bonding with a family that isnât actually his...

Before he made his way to Mr. Bones & Co.'s rescue program in December 2016, CALVIN had been abandoned on the outskirts of Houston, TX and was living in a junk yard. Now 3 years old and 45lbs. CALVIN is all sorts of sweet, goofy, wiggly affection. He does well meeting new people and dogs and is house and crate trained. CALVIN is being fostered near Reading, PA and is available for meet and greets.

The ideal home for CALVIN will have a fenced in yard so he can get his ya-yas out, have active people who enjoy hiking, walking and being outdoors and who understand dogs need structure and consistency. He looks for a confident person on the other end of the leash and wants to take cues from his people!

We will consider a home for him in PA, NY, MD, DC, VA, WV, NJ, OH, DE so please help us make his holiday dreams come true. Apply online via www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt

3,Young,Chihuahua,"Meet Tiffany, sheâs just arriving from Puerto Rico this week.  Tiffany is a sweet 2.5 year old Chihuahua Mix and weighs just 7 pounds.  Sheâs very friendly, well behaved and extremely sweet.  She was thrown over the fence by her âownerâ as they drove away.  She has been spayed and is up to date on her vaccinations.

4,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Whippet","Marshall is a loyal, intelligent 2 and Â½ year old, 50 lb. Whippet / Lab mix.

And what a handsome young man! He is super soft, and has some seriously deep, thoughtful, brown eyes. As he bounces across the room to greet you, you will often see a smile on his face, too.  Talk about unconditional love!

Marshall is a rescue from Puerto Rico, and truly wants to find a forever home with people who understand him and have dog experience. A savvy dog owner is a must, as Marshall can outsmart just about anyone when he puts his mind to it!

He is healthy and active, and would shine in an athletic household. He could be your best running buddy! Boating, biking, hiking â you bring the gear and Marshall is ready to go!

If you live in the country and have a yard, you will genuinely enjoy having Marshall as your companion. He can entertain himself playing with leaves, or shadow you while you work outside, to keep you company (and offer gardening advice!) He just loves to be with his people. With some basic, consistent training he would also be totally amazing off-leash. He does come when called! With pleasure!

Marshall is house broken, crate trained and is gentle taking treats. He absolutely LOVES to snuggle, and would gladly nap on the couch with you for hours after a nice, long run on a Sunday afternoon. Belly rubs?? Yes, please!!

He has asked to be in a household with no children or cats. They make him anxious and he has made it clear that he doesnât want to be around them. Marshall wants to feel relaxed and confident, just like we all do, and he feeds off of his ownerâs feelings â so he needs his new family to be calm, confident and seasoned. He could do very well with another friendly well-mannered dog. The most important component in making this connection successful would be the initial greeting (which we have trainers to assist with, if needed).

Marshall pulls on the leash a bit, out of sheer exuberance to go on an adventure â but this can also easily be fixed with a special collar or more consistent training once he is in a home where he will be long-term. He is an excellent student and learns very quickly.

If you are looking for a super intelligent, loyal, gorgeous dog who loves to learn and to please â Marshall is your man! (Please do not apply if this is your first dog experience).

6,Adult,Labrador Retriever,"Meet Callie- the absolute sweetest girl around. 

Callie loves absolutely everyone, all people, other dogs, cats, and kids. She's just a pure lovebug.  Callie is on the calmer side, as her favorite thing to do is snuggle.  Sheâs gentle and oh-so-sweet. She also loves to go for walks and is up for any adventure you want to go on.  Sheâs such a loving and easy-going girl.  A true gem of a dog.  Callie is 2 years old, 39 pounds and would be a perfect dog for an NYC apartment or a home in the burbs. 

Callie was rescued on the beach in Puerto Rico.  When she saw us, she came up to us wagging her tail and giving us kisses.  As we tried to take her away from the beach, she wouldnât budge.  She guided us back to 4 little puppies she had hidden under a boat.  We brought all of them to safety.  While at our shelter, Callie was been an absolute favorite.  Sheâs just so, so, so sweet, words cannot describe what a good dog she is.  Now months later, Callie is in a foster home in NYC- waiting to meet her new family, who she can love forever. 

Callie is healthy, up to date on her shots and is waiting for her NYC vet appointment to be spayed.

8,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, Border Collie","Our magnificent Hero needs a hero of his own. This beautiful, robust boy is a victim of circumstances. His doting owner lost her home, and desperately tried to find housing to accommodate her beloved companion, whom she had raised from a pup. Hero's Mom took up temporary residence in a local motel, until she could get her bearings, but Hero was booted out by the motel manager. After a tearful goodbye, sad Hero was left in the care of a well-respected town shelter, who pled his case to us.

Hero appears to be a handsome mix of black Labrador Retriever and Border Collie. He has the physique and color of a black Lab, and the white tuxedo markings and black speckled white socks that suggest Border Collie. At 50 pounds, Hero has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Hero loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. 

Hero sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the structure that he needs to to thrive. Hero gives the impression of caution at first, as he sizes up strangers, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. Adopters will need to be comfortable putting boundaries between Hero and strangers: he can become overzealous in guarding his person. He would be the ideal watchdog.

Hero seems subdued and intimidated at times, in the midst of our busy foster home, and we sense that a quiet, adult home would suit him best. He is not a big fan of change, and a steady, quiet routine will serve him beautifully.  Hero would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, can keep a brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality. Hero could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.

Hero has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. The obedience work serves him as a job he can take pride in, and he performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats. Obedience training is key to providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.

Hero has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Hero's transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DA2PP (distemper, adrenovirus, parvo and parainfluenza), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped.

9,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Border Collie","Our stunning Wednesday enters the room like an arctic blast of cold on a hot summer night and grabs your attention! This magnificent one and a half year old, black Labrador Retriever mix came to us from a big city Animal Control facility, where she spent some time after a lackluster owners abandoned her. She was rail thin and gaunt when she entered the city shelter system, and took some time to adjust to her harsh surroundings. 

When Wednesday came to our Rescue, she was a wild child, a Black Beauty in need of some firm, loving leadership. It was painfully obvious that her owners had missed all of her social development cues, and woefully neglected her manners and leadership training. Wednesday was as precocious as her Addams Family namesake, and seemed to feel that her opinion was warranted on just about every subject.

In no time, Wednesday has developed into a canine thoroughbred, brimming with potential. An energy and personality match is key to Wednesday's happiness. She is a high energy, athletic dog who needs alot of outdoor exercise. She would gleefully keep rigorous pace with an avid runner, hiker or powerwalker, and seems to thrive in the brisk country air. No doubt about it, Wednesday needs an active adopter, but, also one who is extremely proficient in leadership and obedience training. She is not a dog for the casual or inexperienced adopter.

Wednesday largely appears to be Labrador Retriever, but we also suspect some Border Collie in her DNA. She is a lean, tall dog weighing 47 pounds, and is extremely graceful and athletic. She runs with great speed, and could be an agility champion. Wednesday has the energy and intelligence that we see in this high strung Herding breed, as well as the mischievious and impertinent tendency that sometimes occurs when Border Collies are under exercised and bored! 

As a double dose of working dog, Wednesday definitely needs a job, and she is a natural at obedience work. She knows all her basic commands, and has passed many of the Canine Good Citizenship tests. She handles beautifully on lead, and heels nicely. Wednesday still needs some polish on her stranger manners, since she may, on occasion, greet someone rudely, but motivated adopters should be able to work her through any issues by employing her well honed commands. In the right hands, Wednesday will become a fantastic, well behaved companion.

Wednesday would fare best in an adult home, with adopters experienced in handling large, active breeds. She would overwhelm toddlers and seniors. She could easily join a multi-dog home, with another active, well trained dog, but sometimes, unruly and ill mannered dogs press her buttons. We have not had her around cats, but she would most likely chase them beyond their tolerance level.

Wednesday has respectable house manners and is mostly housetrained. She will need some finetuning on her potty routine as she transitions to a new environment. Wednesday is in good health, and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for rabies, bordatella, and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been microchipped and dewormed, and is on monthly flea/tick and heartworm treatment.

10,Adult,"Rottweiler, Hound","Our Cupid is a sage soul, who found himself homeless, along with his housemate Eskie, Precious, after his family lost their residence. He entered the confines of NYC ACC, and did not fare well during the rescue process. He became shy, shut down, and suspicious of human touch, so Shelter workers directed him to us, so that we could evaluate him in a more hospitable environment.

We were happy to invite this sad soul to join us, and he has really come out of his shell in foster care. At first meeting, Cupid seems shy and reticent, but he warms quickly once he reconnects to a loving human vibe. He has adjusted beautifully to foster care, has been a joy to handle. Cupid loves people, and is generally friendly to strangers, once he warms up, but would be happiest in a quiet adult home, where he can chill out. 

Cupid would be the ideal companion to an active single, or couple, who have large dog, or Rottie experience. Powerful breeds like Rottweillers and Hounds that have a work ethic bred into their DNA, require purposeful lifestyles that challenge their mental and physical faculties. They also need a strong pack leader to teach them Canine Good Citizenship.

Cupid has excelled in his obedience work, and this is a great way for an adopter to bond with him, and continue to assume a positive leadership role. Cupid has mastered all of his basic obedience commands, and adopters will be able to get him up to speed and into their lifestyle quickly. Cupid has a moderate energy level and does not require an untoward amount of exercise. A couple of brisk leash walks each day should do the trick and keep him happy and balanced.

As an adult dog, Cupid is calm and well behaved in the house. He could easily live in an apartment or home environment, and he would be fine during an 8-hour work day. He would also be happy as the companion to an active retiree with lots of time to spend with him. We think that Cupid may be too sensitive to tolerate young children, and we have not had him around cats. He could easily join a multi-dog home, as he seems to enjoy companionship with his own kind, and has become one of the superstars in our large dog play group.

Cupid has good house manners, and is house trained, to the best of our observation, although adopters need to have realistic expectations of Rescue dogs, who may lose some of their potty Mojo and they as they go from place to place during this unwieldy process. We expect adopters to troubleshoot any housetraining issues after the fact.

Cupid is in excellent health, and has been neutered. He is vaccinated for Rabies, Parvo, adrenovirus, distemper, coronavirus, leptopirosis, canine influenza, and bordatella. He has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

If you are interested in Cupid, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com, or call/text Denise at cell: 860-908-9738 for an adoption application.

11,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Our vivacious Freda has the bouyant good nature that attracts American Pit Bull Terrier folks to this lovable breed. No other breed has been so overbred, mishandled and maligned as the APBT, and we are thrilled to have Freda with us, early in her young life, so that we can find her forever home.

Three years old, Freda started off her rescue journey as a statistic: just one more homeless pit roaming the mean city streets. She has traversed the rescue process with ease, and has displayed great confidence and panache as she has interacted with everyone along the way. (Well... except the police officer who brought her to NYCACC. We hear that she was not his biggest fan, especially after he pepper- sprayed her in the eyes). Freda's shelter behavior evaluations were good, and she was adopted through the shelter adoption program to a young couple who learned quickly that Freda was not a good fit for their low key lifestyle.

NYCACC approached us on Freda's behalf, because Staff and Volunteers had fallen in love with this russet beauty, and we invited her to Connecticut. Freda has been handled with great love, and has a friendly, outgoing temperment, although, she is not a fan of rough handling. She would be a fantastic choice for a gentle bully breed lover, who is willing to continue her exercise and obedience regimen. 

Freda is high energy and needs vigorous exercise. She loves to be on the go: the more action, the better. A bored, frustrated Bully will surely make mischief, but in the hands of dedicated breed enthusiasts, who rejoice in their high energy companions, Pitties are Man's devoted BFFs.

Freda is a total stunner. She is a Red Nose, ABPT, and has twinkling greenish-hazel eyes. Her coat is a pretty reddish carmel with white tuxedo markings, and cute white socks. Freda is a strong muscular dog, and she is at an ideal weight of 50 pounds. She is a strong girl, who require some experienced handling on leash walks. Freda knows all of her basic obedience commands and handles well with assertive leadership.

We think that Freda will thrive in the active home of the experienced Bully Breed lovers, who have a basic understanding of dog behavior and obedience techniques. Freda is very responsive to training, and is both treat and praise motivated. We'd like to avoid homes with small children, since Freda is a strong dog, and may overpower toddlers.

Freda would probably do best in an only dog environment, where she can bask in her family's attention. Freda's adapters will be able to walk her easily on lead in a public place or urban environment, but she may not be an appropriate candidate for unstructured play in a public dog park. Freda likes to play rough, and rough-house play among high energy.dogs can often bubble up into a tiff or two! Freda is not a good candidate for a feline home.

Freda has been thoroughly vetted. She is spayed, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), and has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Freda, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41628351/1/?bust=1526300974 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41628351/2/?bust=1526300980 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41628351/3/?bust=1526301004 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41628351/4/?bust=1526301020 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41628351/5/?bust=1526301026 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41628351/6/?bust=1526301050,Freda,41628351,F,M,A
12,Senior,"Boxer, Foxhound","Our lovely Mama suffered a tortuous intake process at NYCACC, after her owner repeatedly berated her in the crowded shelter Lobby. Our shelter contact witnessed the verbal tongue-lashing and watched in horror as Mama cowered, and shook spastically throughout the entire intake. As Mama was led into the back kennel area, we were called and ask to help her.

Mama is one of those dogs who just brightens the room whenever she enters. It's amazing that such a lovely creature could be so callously abandoned at the age of ten. Mama is a grand old gal, who needs a happy retirement home to spend her golden years. She had earned stellar behavior evaluations, and was placed in the Shelter adoption program, only to be passed over because of her age. 

Although Mama was a favorite among shelter staff and volunteers, her adoption options were limited. Seems that everybody wants to experience puppy hell, and too few people appreciate the considerable benefits of having an older dog, who is well past the puppy mayhem stage. She came to our rescue so that we could cast a wide net, and find her just the right Adopter. 

Mama appears to be a pretty mix of American Foxhound with a smidge of Boxer that adds some strength to her physique. She is a lean, statuesque beauty at an athletic weight of 45 pounds. Her short, flat coat requires minimal grooming, and Mama enjoys the grooming process. Her coat mostly is white with russet brown patches, and scattered black markings on her face. Mama seems more like the elegant Boxer in personali: she seems laid back, demure, and enjoys the companionship of her people. She exudes happiness and joy.

Mama has a very genial nature. She is a sociable dog, and while she has not had much background in obedience, she has grasped the basics and seems to enjoy the training exercises. Mama is easy to walk on lead, and has a moderate exercise level. She would be happy with a few leisurely to brisk leash walks daily and a game of frisbee.

Mama would be a great choice for a moderately active single or couple, a recent retiree or senior. She could easily do well in an apartment lifestyle, and can be trusted home alone for short periods of time. Mama has excellent pack manners, and would be a great addition to a multi-dog household, perhaps as a companion to a senior dog who has lost his or her housemate. Mama is a pretty good all-around companion dog, and needs to be in an environment where her golden years will be spent as the light of someone's life, rather than considered an afterthought.

Mama has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during his transition to a new home. Mama is in great health and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitus, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus) and has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, microchipped and is on preventatives for Heartworm and Flea/Tick.

13,Young,"Australian Cattle Dog / Blue Heeler, Golden Retriever","Our Circles gives the impression of shyness at first, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. He must have quite the tale to tell, after having paid his dues as a big city stray. Circles came to us via our contacts at NYCACC, where he was passed over for adoption during his short window of opportunity. Nonetheless he made friends and admirers of Shelter and Vet staff.

Circles appears to be a handsome mix of Australian Cattle Dog and yellow Labrador Retriever. He has the physique and color of a yellow Lab, and the speckled markings of the Cattle Dog. Weighing 57 pounds, Circles has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Circles loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. 

Circles sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the necessary structure that he needs to thrive.Â He seems subdued, and intimidated at times, and is not a good candidate for a home with small children, or a busy home with a lot of strangers coming and going. 

Circles would thrive in an adult home, with patient folks were willing to troubleshoot some stranger danger issues. He would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, and is greatly suited to a slow-paced country lifestyle.Â He can keep brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality.Â Circles could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.

Circles has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. We've worked with him for quite a while on food and resource guarding, and he has improved greatly. Still, it's best to leave Circles alone while eating, and to feed him separately from any other dogs. The obedience work serves him as a job, he takes pride in it, and performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats.Â Obedience training is key to the providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.

Circles has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Circles' transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptosporosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Circles, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42591079/1/?bust=1535458105 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42591079/2/?bust=1535458107 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42591079/3/?bust=1535458112 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42591079/4/?bust=1535458115 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42591079/5/?bust=1535458119 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42591079/6/?bust=1535458126,Circles,42591079,M,M,A
14,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Our darling ingenue, Queenie, is a real sweetheart, in need of a firm hand, and a structured lifestyle. She came to us recently from NYC ACC, where she had been abandoned by her owners. Queenie was whelped in her owner's apartment, and because the landlord had a very firm ""no dogs"" policy, she was hidden and never allowed outside. Once discovered, Queenie she was promptly evicted.

Like many owner-surrendered dogs, Queenie sufferered trauma as she slowly gave into her new harsh surroundings. Queenie's situation was worse than most, because at 11 months, she had never been outside, had never worn a collar and leash, and was âfloodedâ with a barrage of new sights and sounds. She displayed fearful, uncertain avoidance behavior, at first, so she was transferred to us so that we could give her a chance to chill out, and then get a more accurate picture of her potential.

After a brief time in foster care, Queenie began to come out of her shell, little by little. She impressed us as a shy girl, who needs a little bit of warm up time with strangers. Once she relaxes, Queenie is as loving and gentle as can be. Her Adopters will need to be patient, give her some space at first, and then be willing to troubleshoot occasional fearful reactions.

As a Bully breed mix, Queenie is an energetic girl, who should be challenged with exercise and obedience training. She is fast becoming a fantastic outdoor dog, and would love to join her family on walks, runs or hikes, and participate in outdoor adventures. Queenie would thrive in an active adult home, where she can learn the pack rules. 

As an adolescent, many of Queenie's developmental cues were missed during her puppy stage, and she seems a bit behind the learning curve on obedience and manners. Her new family will need to be prepared to establish house rules, and maintain discipline. In the midst of chaos, Queenie will act up, but in an environment of calm and structure, she is an absolute dream.

No just one year old, Queenie still has her puppy mojo. Her obedience training is coming along well, and she knows most of her commands, but adopters will need to prepare for the antics of an older puppy. She is a moderate-energy girl, and needs at least two to three vigorous leash walks a day, in addition to focused play time and ongoing obedience work. It is essential to challenge Queenie in both mind and body so that she maintains an even keel. If she becomes bored and frustrated, she can become mischievious. Everyone in her new home needs to be on the same page about the importance of exercise and obedience training, and be willing to provide the consistent structure and discipline that an older puppy needs. Her house manners are good, but there may be that inevitable snagged shoe or trash can treasure hunt, while Queenie matures over the next few months.

Queenie seems good natured, although somewhat socially awkward. She would benefit from a multi-dog home, with another energetic, well mannered youngster. She loves her people, and in the hands of a committed adopter, Queenie could become a Canine Good Citizen, who can move through the human world with ease and grace. Adopters should be able to have her CGC certified in a short while. She has grasped her obedience commands and loves the training process.

Queenie is in good health, although still a bit underweight at 31 pounds. Her physique is lean and gangly, not overly muscular as some bullies. She would be at an ideal weight of 35 to 40 pounds. She is house trained and crate trained, but adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during her transition to a new home. She is spayed, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus), and canine flu. She has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, ehrlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Queenie, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call/text Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43248871/1/?bust=1541772828 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43248871/2/?bust=1541772830 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43248871/3/?bust=1541772833 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43248871/5/?bust=1541772839,Queenie,43248871,F,M,A
15,Young,"Beagle, Jack Russell Terrier","Our handsome Skipper is quite an adorable character.Â He came to us from NYC ACC, riding one heck of a popularity wave!Â This sweet little guy charmed everyone and received rave behavior evaluations.Â After spending some time in Brooklyn as a city stray, Skipper was brought to the shelter, so that his owners could be located. When nobody came to claim him, our shelter contacts diverted Skipper to us for some much-needed treatment for low stage Heartworm.

Skipper navigated the stress of the rescue process with ease, and retained his sunny disposition. He was adaptable to a wide variety of circumstances and handlers, and tolerated his heartworm treatment beautifully.Â Our vet has given him a clean bill of health, and he is cleared for adoption.

It's a shocker that a swell fella like Skipper should wind up homeless and alone at just two years of age.Â Shelter staff pegged him as an Jack Russell Terrier, and we think that he favors the Irish version of JRT, in his stocky, short stature.Â We also see a healthy dose of Beagle in Skipper, with his ""Blue Tick"" markings, and tricolor pattern.Â Skipper has a stocky physique, and seems prone to carry about a little bit of heft. He is slightly overweight at 20 pounds, and would be at ideal weight at about 16 to 18.Â His short, smooth coat is low maintenance and easy to groom.

Frankly, Skipper is quite gentlemanly and well-mannered for a JRT.Â He doesn't have the over-the-top frantic energy that we see in some of his compatriots. Instead, we see his Hound instincts take over, as Skipper takes time to ""smell the roses"" on his daily walks. Skipper is well mannered and polite: he approaches cautiously, and waits for an invitation to snuggle in his person's lap.Â He is an affectionate boy, who bonds quickly, once he trusts.

Skipper would be a great choice for an active single or couple who enjoy an energetic Terrier type dog.Â He would be an enthusiastic companion on walks or hikes, and he loves to travel, and be part of the action.Â Skipper could also join an active family with older kids, as long as everyone can commit to his training and exercise schedule.Â The key to Skipper is adequate exercise and mental stimulation to keep him from wallowing in the boredom and frustration that leads to behavior problems.

Skipper is a social boy, and could easily join a home with other well trained, energetic dogs.Â We have not exposed him to cats, but the terrier-cat vibe is a well known dicey commodity, although Skipper is more likely than most to coexist well in a feline home.Â He has begun to grasp the basics of leadership and obedience work, and has passed a few of the Canine Good Citizen tests.Â Skipper has the potential to excel in this program.

Skipper is in excellent health, and has been neutered, and treated for a mild case of heartworm.Â He has been vaccinated for rabies and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been microchipped and dewormed. If you are interested in Skipper please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860 908 9738 for more info.Â 

About us:Â We are an active multi-breed Dog Rescue local to New England, situated on a 90 acre property in Canterbury, Connecticut.Â Our 21 year history is reflected in our website EskiesOnline.com, and on our Facebook page: Eskies Online.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43348430/1/?bust=1542808735 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43348430/2/?bust=1542808738 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43348430/3/?bust=1542808743 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43348430/4/?bust=1542808747 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43348430/5/?bust=1542808751,Skipper,43348430,M,S,A
16,Senior,Chihuahua,"The resurrection of Milo was no small thing. When he first appeared on our radar, Milo looked like a walking cadaver. At 4.1 pounds, Milo had wasted away into a mere ghost of his former self. He was taken to NYCACC by his owner's neighbor, who had been caring for him since her friend had passed away a month earlier. Family members were unwilling to accommodate Milo, so he wound up frightened and homeless, and facing euthanasia in the clink.

The shelter vet estimated Milo's age to be 14 years old, based on his then current physical condition. However, just as it is difficult to assess a dog's behavior in a shelter environment, it is equally difficult to determine age in a dog who is so extremely malnourished and emaciated. When a dog's physical condition deteriorates to this level, the entire health picture looks grim. Blood values such as thyroid, liver and kidney can be off to quite a degree in the face of nutritional deficiency.

We learned early on that the key to adoption for many senior dogs, was to reverse the effects of malnutrition and poor diet, and create robust health. After we bring a dog's whole system back into balance, we frequently see great reversals in blood values. When we achieve optimal health in a senior dog, suddenly they don't look so senior! Our vet frequently overrules the shelters original age estimate.

In Milo's case, we were dealing with a lot of superficial symptoms that mirror the symptoms of major diseases. Our hope was that we could give the little guy a great life for as long as he had. Milo was severely anemic, emaciated, his blood work was all over the place, and he had chronic dental infection. He was in ill health when he came into NYCACC, and then contracted a shelter virus, and had a whole other health challenge to face. Milo was severely ill, and we weren't sure how much fight the little guy had left in him. He seemed depressed at losing his home and his beloved person, and some days he wouldn't eat.

And yet, Milo hung in there. He slowly made progress, and once he was out of quarantine he started to engage with other dogs and became interested in life again. We improved his diet with a grain-free nutritionally dense food, and added a myriad of nutritional supplements to boost his immune system and reverse the anemia. The best news is that the little guy has improved to the point where he can be put up for adoption. He has gone from 4.1 pounds to 6.7, and has been neutered and had a full dental procedure that resolved all of the infection.

Our vet has revised his age to 10 years old. The prognosis for Milo is great, providing his adopter continues him on a healthy diet, and maintains a healthy weight. Milo has a lot of good years left, and a lot of love to give that special someone.

Milo's behavior is exemplary. He is a loving little cuddle bug, and would be a good addition to any type of home. He'd be a great companion to other adult dogs, or perhaps a senior dog, who is recently lost his or her companion. Milo would be great with cats: he's got a genial nature and loves everyone he meets.

Milo is in excellent health, and has been neutered. He has been vaccinated for Rabies and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia. He has been microchipped and dewormed.

About us: We are an active multi breed Dog Rescue local to New England, situated in Canterbury, Connecticut.

17,Young,Beagle,"Lovable Lucas is one of our favorite foster dogs. He is Beagle through and through, right down to his beautiful singing voice. One year old, Lucas joined us a few months ago from NYCACC, after his owner surrendered him to an uncertain fate. Owner surrendered dogs often have a tough time losing their cushy homes and adapting to a harsh shelter environment that breeds stress and fear. 

Lucas did not fare well in the shelter. He became unglued and extremely fearful. His behavior deteriorated quickly, and we were asked to step in before he hit the euthanasia list. We were tickled pink to add another Beagle to our chorus. Lucas contributes the falsetto voice that we were missing.

Lucas appears to be a picture perfect Beagle in appearance and demeanor, and has all the classic traits of a tenacious Scent Hound. He has a sinewy, athletic physique, with trademark glorious, floppy ears! He has the classic Beagle low mainenance, tri-color coat, and is at an ideal lean body weight of 26 pounds. Lucas is true to his Beagle Scent Hound roots. He is easy to entertain with a simple leash walk. Lucas loves the outdoors and savors all of the scents that nature has to offer. He needs two to three brisk leash walks a day to engage his mind and meet his energy needs.

Lucas is this an extremely lovable guy, and generally good-natured, unless you're at the vet. He becomes quite testy at the vet, and we opted to muzzle him for precaution. We recommend that adopters choose a Vet experienced with rescue dogs, and that they be prepared to use the muzzle to get in and out without a lot of drama.

Lucas is generally friendly, but can be suspicious of some strangers at first. He quickly warms to gentle human touch. He likes to engage with his people on his own terms, but is more than willing to follow pack rules when it comes to house manners and obedience training. Lucas would be the ideal companion for an active single or couple, who enjoy outdoor activities. We'd like to steer clear of children in Lucas's home since they may not respect his boundaries, when it comes to his food and toys. 

Lucas will bond quickly and love his family, and will want to be the center of attention. If he is relegated to a fenced-in yard or a separate room in an apartment, he will get fussy and bark for attention. Lucas certainly could be alone for an 8 hour work day, as long as he has toys and chewies to amuse himself, but he is not a fan of isolation. When his folks are home he likes to be in the thick of things. He has a vibrant, intense personality, that will thrill Beagle people. He's very typical of the breed.

Lucas loves to play with other dogs, and has been one of the Superstars of our Big Dog play group. He holds his own with a pack of large Coonhounds and random Rottie-Shepherd mixes. Lucas would be a great fit for folks who have another young dog that likes to play. As an older puppy, Lucas did not have the benefit of much obedience work in his former home. He has begun to master the basics, but his adopter should be prepared to provide additional training, discipline and structure, and continue him on the path to Canine Good Citizenship.

Lucas is in excellent health and has been neutered. He has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), He has been boostered as needed. He has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. If you are interested in Lucas, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.

18,Senior,Miniature Pinscher,"If the Miniature Pinscher is the ""King of the Toys,"" then our Sister Midnight is the breed's Queen Dowager. She has a comedic quality that is an irreverent blend of old school Rosie O'Donnell and Bette Midler. Midnight is bold and intense, and her antics will keep her family in stitches. 

Midnight, ten years old, came to us in a shell shocked state, after her callous owner dumped her in a high kill big city animal control facility. It is always unsettling for a senior dog to lose his or her home, but the stark shelter experience is especially frightening. The stress level in the shelter took its toll on Midnight, and she did not weather the change well. Fortunately, she was rerouted to our rescue shortly before she hit the euthanasia list. 

Midnight has relaxed and settled into foster care nicely. She's an outgoing dog, and frankly, a bit of a budinski. Midnight happily minds everybody else's business, and she seems to get away with it most of the time. In the dog pack, she does her best to try and maintain social order, and she is fairly successful, but sometimes, she will come across a much larger dog who will put her in her place, and luckily for Midnight, she has enough common sense to back down.

Midnight would be a great choice for an active adult couple, or energetic retiree, who enjoy a spirited small dog. She is extremely loving and affectionate: the perfect lapdog. She would also do well in an easy going family, with older, dog savvy kids. She could easily join a multi-dog home, and would make an excellent companion for another senior dog, who may have recently lost his or her housemate. Midnight would probably do well in a feline home with dog savvy cats tolerant of a pushy canine personality.

Technically, at 10 years old, Midnight is a senior, but her energy level suggests a much, much younger dog. She has a lively, vibrant personality, and a pretty high energy level. She needs at least one to two brisk leash walks a day, in addition to frequent potty breaks. Midnight would be a fantastic walking companion for an active senior or couple. Exercise is important for Midnight because she loves to snack, and if adopters do not monitor her diet and exercise, she will blow up like a balloon!

Midnight is house trained and crate trained, but adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during her transition to a new home. She is spayed, and in good health. We have done exhaustive vet work, and health screening to take the guesswork out of adopting an older dog. She has had a complete dental procedure, and tolerated anesthesia well. Her teeth are in great shape, and that is key to longevity for a senior dog.

Midnight has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, parvo, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, and coronavirus), and canine flu. She has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Midnight please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call/text Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.

?
Roxy is housebroken and walks nicely on leash but she can be fearful of skateboarders and very sudden movement. She is also nervous aroundÂ other dogs, so she needs to remain a single lady. Despite her nervousness she warms up quickly to strangers with proper introductions.Â

According to her foster mom, Eden is very sweet and loyal. She needs to be around her family and is smart as a whip.
?
Eden is housebroken and walks nicely on leash. She has some separationÂ anxiety which has made crate training difficult, but her foster mom is working on correcting the behavior. Eden needs to be an only pet in a home with no children. She may have her quirks but she wants nothing more then snuggle and love her family.
?
The perfect forever home for Eden is one that is active and has ample time to spend with her.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36307405/1/?bust=1474660038 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36307405/2/?bust=1474660039 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36307405/3/?bust=1474660040 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36307405/4/?bust=1499705836 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36307405/5/?bust=1499705836 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36307405/6/?bust=1540767525,Eden,36307405,F,M,A
23,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Sophie is a seven year old  American Staffordshire Terrier/Boxer/Lab mix we believe.

She was saved from the New York City ACC - the kill shelter by a man who adopted her.  He was smitten with her when he first met her and adopted her from the shelter.  

Today he faces health problems which makes him unable to care for her any longer so Pound Hounds is stepping in to help him rehome her.

A little about Sophie:  She was surrendered to the NYACC because her owners were moving.  As for her temperment, I honestly can not imagine there being a sweeter dog.  She is incredibly loving.  However, while she loves being around people, she has not misbehaved in any way when left alone.  On walks, people on the street are constantly stopping me asking if they could say hello to her, and she loves it.  She is equally sweet with other dogs.  I have taken her on numerous ocassions to the dog park where she plays gently with other dogs.  While I have not seen her interact with cats, she tends to ignore them when she sees them on the street.  

Sophie is completely house trained and very obedient.  She comes whenever called and sits, lays down, and gives paw when asked.  When I say go lay down in your bed (which is in my bedroom) she does so wherever we are in the apartment.  

I never saw her swim.  However, when visiting a friend in Upstate New York this summer, she tempted to wade in a natural pond.  

Sophie is approx 65 lbs, healthy, UTD on vaccinations, microchipped and spayed.

If you'd like more information on this chocolate goddess, please contact us at once!

24,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"AK was brought to the NYACC shelter after his owner and caretaker were arressted.  He was darted by the police and brought to the shelter.  Shortly thereafter, we landed on the Euthanasia List.  His foster mom stepped up to save his life.

His stats:  Approx 4 years old, Neutered.  UTD on vaccinations and Microchipped.

This is what is foster mom says:

AK/Baby is a puppy in a big dog's body.  He hasn't been taught to much in his life, so he needs someone with lots of patience.

He is not a big barker and knows how to push open a door.

We feel he would be ok with larger kids as he jumps and he's a big dog.  He's very food motivated, so training with treats is the way to go with this guy.

If you'd like to meet your next best friend, please don't hesitate with this hunk!

26,Senior,"Chihuahua, Rat Terrier","This dog may know the universal constant. Perhaps the smartest little trickster we ever came by, this escape artist climbs out of his playpen to sneak the catfood we put down and then sneaks right back in. We finally caught him under cover of night doing this and immediately after telling him no, he ran down stairs and climbed right back into his playpen and literally pretended to be asleep when we followed him down! He climbs out whenever we cook and or watch TV too now, sneakily slinking his way into out laps and under the covers. He is clearly a foodie, will thieve snacks, loves constant contact, lives for fluffy bedding, and can be a little territorial when he has to share a lap. He would love to be the one and only but currently cohabitates well enough.

30,Adult,Chihuahua,"Very sweet, gentle, kissy, foodie, loyal, super submissive chi girl. Wouldnât mind traveling around with you in a handbag, but not a great leash walker as she is very timid in loud and unfamiliar environments. Likes dog park time if there are other chis, plays well with other small dogs and could care less about cats. Wouldnât mind being a house dog if you are a stay at home pet parent as she is needy and likes lazy lap and kissy time more than daily walks. Peeped pad trained, but fostered without rugs jic. Would prefer to follow the lead of a city savvy dog, and would languish alone at home so prefer homes with another gentle small dog or a work from home parent. She is a loyal companion for life and will stare lovingly into your eyes until your heart breaks into a million pieces, sooooo sweet.

32,Adult,Pomeranian,"Given away by their owners to friends, then given to the shelter by those friends....meet the bonded pair with the names we didn't give them, lol. They are approx 4 and 7 and weigh 12 and 8lbs approx. They appear bonded so we may need to keep them together, but they are brand new so time will tell for sure. They are energetic and sweet and seem to have had a fairly sheltered upbringing as strangers initially scare them. They are coming out of their shells more everyday and have excellent crate manners to date.

34,Baby,Mixed Breed,"Please give a round of applause to our beloved Andy! Andy is the sweetest, goofiest, most loving pup who has stolen the hearts of everyone here at Bideawee over the past few months. He loves people, other dogs, and even cats due to his good nature. The reason this pup of perfection has been here for a while is because Andy has had some medical issues and has been diagnosed with Megaesophagus. This affects the way Andy needs to eat, but otherwise he is a healthy and active boy who is very ready to find a home of his own. The Dodo website recently featured Andy, so to learn about his condition please check out the video link here: https://www.facebook.com/DodoImpact/videos/213249196236489/UzpfSTEzNjU2NDYxMzAyNjQwOToyNDExODc5Nzk1NDk0ODY4/ When he's done eating, Andy loves to play, is very affectionate, loves going on walks, and truly believes he is appropriately sized to be a lapdog. You can meet Andy just like any other dog at our Manhattan location, although please note that it's most likely that we will not be doing same day adoptions for him. Come meet Andy today!

Although he is missing his front leg, Jack gets around just fine, and loves going out on his daily walks. He is a beautiful boy donning two different colored eyes; one brown and one bright blue. He is a great investigator and you dont have to worry about dropping that extra piece of turkey on the floor, hes on it! When hes done helping around the house, Jack loves nothing more than to lay his head on your lap to take a snooze. This guy is already one of our secret favorites (secret because of course we don't play favorites!) and we love him to bits. Jack would do best with an experienced dog owner and in a home with no children.

He loves to run and is nuts about playing and tossing his toys around. Combine those two things with the fact that he's still a puppy who doesn't quite have the best balance or grace, and you have our sill and loveable Gaspar.

Samantha has been with us at Bideawee for too long and we are scratching our heads as to why this fabulous girl just can't get a break! She originally hails from Puerto Rico but it turns out that she loves the snow so perhaps she was always a New Yorker at heart. In addition to loving the snow, Samantha appears to love a lot of things about life. She loves people and snuggles, and she really loves getting out and going on walks or playing outside. Since Samantha has been here for a while, she's become a little quirky about meeting other dogs, but she likes dogs that she knows. Aside from a refresher for housebreaking, she's pretty good about doing her business outside and she knows her basic commands. She loves to please people and is what the scientific dog books refer to as a ""good girl"".

58,Senior,"Australian Cattle Dog / Blue Heeler, Dachshund","Coal, a 13-year old, 25-pound, Australian Cattle Dog / Dachshund / Min Pin (all confirmed by Wisdom DNA panel!) is a lot like your favorite pair of old, broken-in shoes: Cozy, comfy and irreplaceable. A new pair would NEVER feel quite the same!

At home, he is content to sit with you on the couch or finding a soft warm dog bed to plop down on. He is not separation anxiety-ridden, in-your-face kinda guy! He's also housebroken and pad trained. He does not act his age and has energy! He knows simple commands such as sit and come. Coal will do best with a patient owner that understands he needs to build up trust. 

Coal does not hear as well as he did when he was a younger lad, but he navigates his world like a champ and only asks that you approach him gently so as not to startle him. He enjoys a tender touch, he hardly barks, sleeps through the night, can co-exist with other dogs and isn't much of a shedder. 

Coal is a sweet, floppy-eared, adorable, black-and-silver coated senior gentleman who deserves a low-key retirement home where he can hang his hat and enjoy some serious lovin'!

59,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"We can pretty much all agree that miso soup is warm, soothing and delicious...right? Well, so is Miso the dog! This 3-year old, 42-pound Pit Bull Terrier mix isn't served up with a soup spoon, but sheâs a pile of mush and youâll still wanna eat her up!

Miso is a gorgeous girl with a fabulous fawn-colored coat, and toes that look like they were dipped in white paint. She is usually laid back and mellow, but once you get her going, her spirited, playful side emerges. A fan of fresh air, Miso also enjoys romping around outside, she loves going for walks, and she struts her stuff like a runway model!

Miso can peacefully co-exist with other canines and is friendly, respectful, and affectionate to all humans. A well-behaved poochie, she knows the commands sit and come, and will go in her crate when directed to do so. Miso is one of those dogs who is super sweet and snuggly, without being jumpy, drooly or invasive. Nice!!!

It wonât take much to make this girl happy. All sheâs looking for is kindness, caring and cuddles...plus maybe a prime spot on the couch...and for that, sheâll give you her undying loyalty and eternal love.

62,Adult,Labrador Retriever,"Gaze into Abbyâs soft round eyes, and youâll immediately notice her sweet gentle soul. Abby is a well-mannered, 7-year old, 81-pound Labrador Retriever mix with a heart of gold. 

This fine lady is dog and cat-friendly and wonderful with humans of all ages. She is 100% housebroken, is respectful around food, doesnât jump, and loves going for walks. Sheâs smart as a whip and knows a bunch of commands, including sit, lie down, come, heel, and paw. She enjoys playing with toys and she loves being pet, having her ears scratched, and receiving belly rubs. 

A go-with-the-flow kinda girl, Abby has the perfect blend of energy and couch potato-ness. She can be upbeat, peppy, and exuberant, but can be just as happy lounging on the couch with you, cuddling, snuggling, napping, and watching TV. 

Abby is a terrific traveler and gets really excited about going in the car. She will hop into the passenger seat, sit nicely, and will stick her head out the window, letting the gentle wind blow her velvety ears. You can literally take this dog anywhere! If you are in the market for a new fun bestie with whom to journey through life, Abby should be calling your name!

63,Adult,Boxer,"Sexy, sassy, and smart...with a dash of mystery and boldness for added spice!  Câmon...give it up for Cher, a 2-year old, 44-pound Boxer mix. She probably wonât sing for you, but what she CAN do is offer round-the-clock cuddles, kisses, and companionship to the human(s) in her life!

Cher is fit as a fiddle and enjoys horsing around with other dogs. If she has a backyard where she can freely roam, she will surely use it well. She loves visits to the dog park too. Though somewhat wary of strangers, once Cher gives you the sniff test, she is warm, friendly and charming. But hey, true to her namesake, she believes the paparazzi should introduce themselves first, before taking photographs or clamoring for autographs!

This beautiful lady is housebroken, mellow, respectful, a good eater, and will sit for treats. She is extremely loyal and loving, and would literally give you the coat off her back, if she could. How can you NOT fall for that sweet face?!

64,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Who can resist the cuteness of a multi-colored, curly-eared canine? If your answer is NO ONE, then listen up, âcause weâve got one for you! Her name is Sky, and sheâs a 10-month old, 46-pound Pit Bull Terrier mix who is charming, playful, housebroken, and dog friendly!

This magnificent mound of fur is big on cuddles and low on drama. She enjoys going for walks, sheâs obsessed with balls and frisbees, and she loves being pet. An outdoorsy type, Sky digs romping along the shoreline and will eagerly jump into the water, weather permitting. If youâre looking for an excuse to exercise - - and câmon, the new year is already upon us - - Sky is your girl!

Fascinated by sights, smells, sounds and new experiences, Sky wants to live life to the fullest. Sheâs a great traveler and a fun co-pilot, regardless of your destination! Adventure is her middle name! 

This stunner is a quick learner and has mastered several commands, including sit and paw. She aims to please, sheâs generous with affection, and sheâll return your kindness triple-fold with her love, devotion, and a never-ending sense of loyalty.

65,Baby,Pit Bull Terrier,"Interested in adding a living, breathing teddy bear to your life? Then check out Justin, an 18-pound, 3-month old (as of 12/13) Lab/Pit Bull mix.  OK, OK, so maybe Justinâs really a dog, but he might as well be a teddy bear! Soft, cuddly, sweet, floppy, and cute as a button. 

This pupperâs got it all! He loves to snuggle, heâs terrific on a leash, heâs great with humans, heâs wonderful with dogs, and he travels with ease. He is super playful, but understands when itâs time to chill out. He obediently goes into his crate whenever directed to do so, including at bedtime. And get THIS - - heâs is nearly 100% housebroken which is pretty awesome for a dog of his age! Definitely a smart cookie!

Justinâs main goal in life is having fun and pleasing his people. He fusses over nothing. He has a very healthy appetite and never met a treat he didnât like! In fact, this dude is so darn happy all the time, his name should probably BE Happy! :-)

66,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Hound","Would waking up every morning next to a youthful, fit, pretty girl with soft brown eyes and a golden tan be your kinda thing? Yes? Then please let us introduce you to young Paisley! This dog-friendly dreamy dame is a 1.5 year old, 45-pound Labrador/Hound mix who loves being cuddled, caressed, kissed, and fed! Hmmm, who doesn't!!?

Paisley is super smart and seems very eager to learn new things. She can get lost in her toy-box and loves playing around with other dogs. Yet Paisley is just as happy chilling out. She is a go-with-the-flow kind of gal and will follow the lead and activity level of the humans around her. And speaking of humans, wow, she absolutely adores EVERYONE! Paisley yearns for human companionship and is at her best when in the company of others. 

Always wanting to be a good girl, Paisley has been working on her leash-walking skills and is gaining more confidence every day. Given her huge heart and sensitive soul, Paisley responds quite lovingly when being spoken to tenderly, with that good-girl, sweety-sweet, tone-of-voice. This gentle lady is a naturalborn people pleaser who will forever express her gratitude to you for giving her a safe, stable life she so desperately deserves.

67,Senior,Shepherd,"Demi is delightful...and likely has some hidden talents too! Rumor has it, this 10-year old, 45-pound Shepherd/Husky mix once acted as an unofficial service dog and supposedly understands sign language! How cool is THAT?

Regardless of her past life or potential skills, this much is true: Demi is a great dog. This mature fluffer has an easy-going demeanor, a kind heart, and a penchant for taking long naps on the couch. She enjoys leisurely walks, likes every human she meets, is respectful around other dogs, doesnât jump, doesnât bark (although she loves to howl with the firehouse sirens!), and never begs for food. 

A fan of fresh air, Demi is very comfortable being outside in any sort of weather and appears to be fully housebroken. She sleeps through the night like an angel and wakes up only after given the okay to do so. She has a gentle mouth, savors her meals, and has minimal interest in chew-bones. She ignores squeakies and plush toys too - she thinks those are appropriate for only babies or little dogs! ;-)

Demi is affectionate without being needy, sheâs particularly fond of belly rubs, and sheâs thrilled when anyone pays attention to her...ANYONE...including the FedEx man and the landscaping guys!

This healthy, beautiful, low-maintenance creature would make a wonderful pet for anyone seeking a calm, quiet, sensitive soul whose only desire at this point in time is to love and be loved. And sheâs VERY easy to love!

68,Adult,Labrador Retriever,"Give Aspen a snow-capped welcome! Canât you just picture this 1-year old, 40-pound, sexy hot blonde skiing down the slopes of the Colorado Rockies? This Labrador Retriever mix would love to, if she could! Because just like her namesake, fun and adventure is what Aspen is all about!

A head-turner wherever she goes, Aspen greets humans, big and small, with confidence, charm and affection. She loves to play, sheâs a HUGE cuddler, and sheâs got all the right moves! This ray of sunshine is good with other dogs, responsive to treats, and appears to be 100% housebroken. She is fully crate-trained and sometimes chooses to chill out in her crate with the door wide open, for no apparent reason at all! Just because!

Aspen enjoys going for walks, is decent on a leash, and has a couple of energy spurts throughout the day, but not in an off-the-wall, hyped up kind of way. She knows how to tone it down and she also appreciates a nice long nap! Aspen has a gentle mouth and will drop food or possessions when/if directed to do so. She tends to NOT overeat and as such, will likely have no trouble maintaining her girlish figure! ;-)

Aspenâs ideal home would be one that offers love, affection, stimulation, and companionship...with a healthy supply of chew bones and squeaky toys on hand!

69,Senior,Shih Tzu,"Thereâs something so special about Shih Tzus and Alicia is no exception to the rule. Sweet, petite, fluffy and spry, Alicia is about 10-years old and maybe 6 pounds soaking wet. 

Despite having limited vision, Alicia is 100% normal, happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. She loves going for walks, has terrific leash skills, is fully housebroken, and gets along well with humans and other dogs. She sports a stunning black-and-white coat which is soft and luxurious, that makes petting her a highly addictive pleasure. Best part? She does not shed! 

This mature munchkin is a mega snuggler, super quiet, very mellow, and travels well. Her tiny size and flexible demeanor make it easy to take her anywhere and everywhere youâll ever wanna go. Alicia is one of those dogs you canât help but immediately fall in love with. A total gem, she deserves the best life ever.

70,Adult,Chihuahua,"Life would be better with Beta! This 7-year old, 16-pound adorable Chihuahua mix is the kind of dog thatâll make your heart go pitter-patter. Sweet, smart, soft, and kind, Betaâs got it all. 

Beta is pad-trained and will also do her business outside while exploring the yard. She sleeps like a log through the night and will not make a peep until itâs morning-time. She gets along well with other dogs and cats, and isnât much of a barker either. With humans, she is a tad shy at first, but pleasant with everyone she meets (young and old alike), and loving once she knows you. 

This little pipsqueak has been learning some commands and is responsive to treats, a gentle voice, and being pet. She travels well in a carrier, and her size and mellow nature make taking her places super easy and fun. If youâre looking for a BFF and co-pilot with whom to share lifeâs adventures, Betaâs your girl!

Astro is a majestic beautiful blue Pitbull that has a heart as big as his head!
At just 4 years old and 78 pounds, he is a great companion for running, walking and lounging around. He loves kids and dogs alike, as well as cats.   

Astroâs foster family says he is LOVES to cuddle â in fact in may be his favorite past time. He also loves to play with toys â (strong ones like a Kong work great for a dog like Astro). He enjoys many walks a day and could be a great running/walking companion. He walks beautifully on a leash. He also loves to play with other dogs, so a trip to the dog park and a movie night cuddling on the couch would be an ideal day for Astro! 

Astro is currently working on his housetraining and is doing excellent especially when someone is home to remind him to go out. Â 

Astro is a great sharer! He does not have any issues sharing his treats, toys or bowls. He is also a smart cookie â and has already mastered: sit, come, down and stayâ¦ GO ASTRO!!!

73,Baby,Shepherd,"Nutty...but in a good way! Thatâs Walnut, for ya! This 10-month old, 35-pound, tan-coated, Shepherd mix is silly, playful, energetic, charming and handsome...and is seeking a love thatâs pure and true. 

An ideal day for Walnut would include a visit to the dog park, lots of treats, plenty of cuddles, a nice long stroll through the âhood, a chicken-n-kibble dinner with a side of fresh water ;-), and a belly rub right before bedtime. It doesnât take much to make this bubbly boy beam!

Walnut enjoys being outside, walks well on a leash, likes being pet, loves playing with toys, and absolutely adores other dogs. Heâd romp around all day with another spirited pooch pal, if he could! Walnut is housebroken, can hold his bladder for 6-plus hours, and has been learning a ton of commands. He is smart and obedient, he aims to please, and he expresses his gratitude to whomever cares for him by gently licking their hand or their nose. Awwwwwww!

If youâre looking for a soft-as-silk lover boy who likes to both give and receive affection (sounds like the perfect boyfriend, eh?), youâve come to the right place! Câmon...admit it...you NEED this Walnut in your life!

90,Adult,Yorkshire Terrier,"If you like what you see, then donât waste another second! Get your application in STAT! Chester is a 2-year old, 7-pound Yorkie mix, and this dudeâs the freakinâ bomb! Sweet, scruffy, spunky and smart, Chester has all bases covered, and he hits it out of the park every time. 

This handsome fella is warm and loving to every human he meets, and agreeable and playful with other dogs. When no one is around to amuse him and he isnât in the mood for a nap, Chester will hilariously rummage through his toy bin (of like 50 different items!) to find the exact toy he MUST HAVE to occupy himself :-). Heâs a funny little bugger, for sure!

Chester enjoys going for walks, heâs 100% housebroken, and will use a wee-wee pad, if need be. He knows the commands come, no, stop, and spin. Affectionate, gentle, and calm, Chester is a master snuggler and will roll over on his back when he wants a belly rub. And guess what? You wonât find a single piece of his hair on your couch because Chester is a non-shedder! Woo-hoo!

For such a small guy, Chester has got a surprisingly hearty appetite and he isnât picky about food. More kibble, pleeeez! Interested in making this adorable, lovable, chowhound part or your everyday life? You should be! Heâs perfect!

Jess is friendly with everyone she meets and makes dog friends wherever she goes. She is housebroken, crate trained, and walks beautifully on a leash. Her small frame makes her a pleasure to cart around, and she is more than happy to accompany you, regardless of the destination. Just think how much more fun life would be having your furry new BFF at your side as you run your daily errands?

This little angel is surprisingly mellow, given her age and breed. Her favorite place to be is in someone elseâs lap, and she is a VERY snuggly, warm, and affectionate cuddle-bug. However, while sheâs a real people dog and prefers being with her humans, Jessâ flexible demeanor enables her to hang out independently and just do her own thing too. Loving but not clingy! The perfect mate, eh?

92,Senior,"Chihuahua, Jack Russell Terrier","What a handsome devil! Say hello to Chewy, a sweet, petite, 12-year old, 16-pound Chihuahua/Jack Russell Terrier mix. 

Donât worry - - Chewy wonât be chewing up any of your stuff! As a more mature man, Chewy knows a thing or two about proper behavior. He is fully housebroken, he will go into his crate when directed to do so, he walks like a champ on a leash, and he hardly ever barks. He is extremely bright and obedient, and he knows a whole host of of commands, including sit, wait, come, ok, and crate. 

Chewy is excellent with people and loves being pet. He is a snuggly sort of fellow, and will happily sit on the couch with you while you watch TV or surf the Internet.

It takes a little while for Chewy to warm up to other pooches, so the best situation for this cute little bugger would be a home with another laid back, mellow-ish, respectful dog! 

Chewy enjoys his food, loves all treats, and will never steal food off of the coffee table. At home with his humans, Chewy is pretty much a perfect dog: Calm, cuddly, caring, kind, and oh-so-sweet!

96,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Meet Bubba, the man of the hour! The minute you gaze into his eyes, youâll feel something tug at your heart. Thatâs because this 1-year old, 42-pound Pit Bull mix is so darn handsome, charming and sweet, that heâll literally have you at hello!

Bubba is a playful goof, and spreads good cheer to everyone he meets, including children. Heâs a barrel of monkeys with other dogs, and his favorite excursion is a trip to the dog park. He gets excited when he sees his leash come out, and he loves being outside, luxuriating in all the sights, sounds, and smells of the world around him. 

Curious, with a strong sense of adventure, Bubba is unflappable in new environments. He is a gem in a car, and you can take him anywhere you need to/want to go. An experienced co-pilot, he might even try to help out with directions by sticking his big beefy head out the window to assess your whereabouts! ;-)

If youâre in the market for a VERY kissy-face, affectionate dog, Bubba is the one! A total love machine, he likes getting in real close and if he could, heâd crawl right into your skin. Heâs too big to be a lap dog, but this dude is one helluva snuggly-bunny! 

Always striving to make his human happy and proud, Bubba is 100% housebroken and a very good boy when left alone.

This fuzzy ball of energy is a total love machine. He is really smart, quite curious, very snuggly, and oh-so-funny! He adores adults, kids, dogs, cats, and probably aliens too! He is playful and upbeat, but pretty much gets it when itâs time to settle down. Once heâs tuckered out, this youngster is down for the count! He loves his naps almost as much as he loves liver snaps! And thatâs saying a lot! ;-)

Sylas is crate-trained, getting the hang of the wee-wee pads, and working on his housebreaking skills. He sleeps through the night without making a peep! This fine fabulous fella is such a good boy and heâll only keep getting better!

102,Adult,Staffordshire Bull Terrier,"MEET ANNIE!

Annie is one of those dogs that just captures your heart ... she is such a sweetheart! As her foster mom puts it, ""she is a love"". She loves to cuddle, loves to put her head on  your lap, loves to have her belly rub. 
She also LOVES to play ball, and with her toys. 
Plus, she ADORES water! Baths, swims, a good run with the garden hose! 

Annie is very trainable and eager to please. She's been learning her leash manners from a trainer and doing great. 

Annie's ideal home? One that gives her lots of love, care and attention. Lots of walks and time outside in the fresh air. Though she might be fine with a submissive male (intros always needed); she would be perfectly okay as the solo queen bee. An adult only home or one with older kids. 

... And a home that loves her unconditionally and is committed to her for life, we promised this very special girl that!

Annie does have a missing eye (a mystery since she came to our rescue like that) but it does not impact her ONE bit, she does everything her two-eyed canine companions do! 

Annie is house trained and crate trained (in fact she eats her dinner in her crate). She is about three years old and weighs a petite 50 lbs. She is utd and spayed.

Have questions? Want to meet the amazing Annie? Please contact reboundhounds@gmail.com and her rescue will respond quickly, thanks!

104,Senior,"Pit Bull Terrier, Mixed Breed","Why should you love Angus?  Let us count the ways!  Gus is a 7-8yrs young oddball who's always happy to be going wherever he's going - wherever that may be!  He looooves to meet people along the way when he's not busy pouncing on leaves as they blow across the sidewalk.  Despite being a rickety old man, he has a playful pep in his step that inspires all his fans to narrate his every move in a dopey voice to match his silly energy -- and on the flip side, he can be determinedly lazy for 15 hrs straight while he practices his most inventive napping positions!  In his past life, Gus lived harmoniously with another dog, a cat, and children, and he has met some new dog friends since.  And to top it all off, he has an endless repertoire of googly-eyed facial expressions and choral stylings that will keep you laughing!  

Angus is house-trained and well behaved when left alone in the house.  He is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and ready to find his special someone!  If you love to snuggle and have a sense of humor to match his, email adopt@rescuzillanyc.org and prepare for a warm welcome!

Meet Maverick!

Maverick is such a wonderful canine! So sweet natured, he loves his humans. He will make someone an exceptional companion for life. 

Maverick's ideal home would be one that continues his training (he has been with a trainer and has done great), gives him daily sufficient exercise in the form of runs, walks, hikes, ball playing, etc., so he can burn off his energy and stay happy and balanced. A home that gives him structure and boundaries. And one that will give him a grain free diet (he does have food allergies, but doing really well on the diet he's on, just a matter of giving grain free). 

Maverick should go to an adult only home or one with kids over ten. He is a bit picky about the dogs he is with, but has had success with females over 50 lbs. (Meet 'n greets to ensure compatibility is always needed.). 

Maverick has come a long way, and he is such a great dog! He can only go to the most loving, caring home, one committed to him for life, we promised him that! 

Maverick is house trained and crate trained. He is about two and half years old and weighs about 65 lbs. He is utd on his shot and is neutered and healthy.

109,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, Pointer","My name is Chloe aka Cloelicious or Mushy Girl.
I'm a 4-year-old female Lab/Pointer/Pit mix whose got a lot of love to give. I love to be loved. I can love on my people 24/7. I was dumped like garbage after giving birth. I was starving and emaciated with sores all over my body. I was terrified at the kill shelter curling myself up in a tiny ball so no one would notice me.
A lovely young college student came to visit the shelter one day and decided to foster me knowing I didn't stand much of a chance of getting out of this  High Risk Kill shelter. She was my last chance. Here's what she has to say about me:

Fast forward 2 months and Chloe is thriving in with her foster mom and is looking for her forever home. Chloe LOVES to cuddle and be around people. She is great with kids. She's friendly and loves to give kisses. Chloe is house trained and knows simple commands. Chloe is working with a trainer to help with her leash skills and  not being reactive to other dogs when she sees them. She is currently working with a trainer to help with some behavior modifications with other dogs. Something happened in Chloe' past that makes her extremely reactive to other dogs. At this time Chloe should be a single dog or go to someone who is  highly experienced and can separate while in training. Chloe is a lovable force of nature. Although she has great energy she also loves to hang out  and watch good movies. Chloe is excellent in the car and loves to Rock Shades while her person is driving. She plays fetch and loves toys. This sweet gal would make a great companion for someone whoâs looking for a dog that gives a lot of affection. Chloe is spayed, vaccinated, dewormed, and flea-treated. Chloe is now approximately 70 lbs of pure love.

115,Adult,"Mixed Breed, Yorkshire Terrier","Pudding is a sweet and timid pup who is still getting used to living in the big city. She loves when her foster dad works from home because she can snooze all day long on a bed underneath his desk. She sleeps peacefully in her crate at night after several minutes of whining and settling down, and she is working on her housebreaking (she is pretty good at using pee pads and has started to go to the bathroom outside as well). She currently lives with two dogs and gets along with them quite well, but has no interest in playing.

116,Adult,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Mixed Breed","Foster Mom Update! Pig (aka Piggy, Pork Chop, Porky Pig, Monkey, Meatball) is a 4-5 year old potato/pig/staffie mix who gets her name from her short stature, piggy grunts, and cuddly nature. She is deaf, but has attended two weeks of board & train with a professional trainer and is now acclimated to the remote collar for better communication. She knows hand signals for sit, down, come, and will go in the crate with a point command. She loves the eat and will usually run to the crate and knows to lie down in the crate to get the bowl. After a standard decompression period (just a little restlessness and desire to explore), Pig is a dream in the house. She is very food motivated, and also very sleep motivated. She loves to sleep on her back, snoring away, and cuddling is one of her best skills. She will not jump on furniture unless invited, and generally will come from another room when the vibrate function on the collar is used. She is usually happy to sit and chew on an antler, and while she initially had some crate anxiety and I would expect there to be another settling in period in a new place, she now goes in the crate easily and settles very quickly. Every time I check the camera she is happily snoozing away. I put the bark collar on her when I go, but I've stopped even turning it on now. Pig was a ""playgroup rock star at the shelter, and in foster is no different. She plays exuberantly with her pit bull foster sister, and does not react to her grumpy senior shih tsu foster sister when she gets riled up. I don't let her say hi to dogs on the street (just a general rule for all my fosters), but while she sometimes gets excited or will lie down in anticipation with an approaching dog, she has never reacted aggressively to a dog. We think that because she is deaf, Pig is easily startled on walks when she doesn't see people coming. In NYC, this is particularly challenging because there are just so many people. Pig would thrive in a less crowded environment, with a handler who is confident walking her and able to find the appropriate balance of confidence and caution. She loves dogs so that's one barrier that's not an issue! Someone with experience with deaf dogs would be ideal, since that's where we believe her anxiety on leash stems from given that she can't hear people approaching. She is trained on the bark collar when left alone and crated (and like I said above, I don't even turn it on anymore), and trained on the remote collar inside and outside on leash. She is a total love bug with me and all people who she is not startled by and has shown no aggression or even anxiety towards people inside with a proper intro. Totally housebroken, great in the bath, and she loves her food! She will make a fantastic loyal companion for the right family in the right environment, and she'd love to have canine siblings! Deaf dog experience a plus! _____________ Pig is a 4 year old staffordshire terrier mix who is fully grown at a low-riding 50 lbs.

129,Young,Border Collie,"Recently we started working with a rescue in Turkey. Like in most Middle East Countries, these dogs have little to NO chance of being adopted as they are not ""purebred"". There are little to no shelters and governemnt funding for animal welfare is rare. These animals need us and we would never turn our back on an animal in need. 

Meet Terra~ 

Terra's story from his Rescuer: His video was first seen on social media, which showed him living chained to what was basically a poultry house. He didnât even have a proper shelter and the people who saw him said that he was constantly being kept tied up, and was not fed for days at times. I talked to the man who took his videos and he talked to the âownerâ of the dog and explained that the dog was going to die there if they insisted on keeping him. The âownerâ let us rescue him, he spent 2 weeks at the vet, during which he was neutered and given vitamins/supplements as he had a mild cold and was very skinny. Heâs been at the dog hotel ever since and we now know that he is a very well behaved and a very very smart dog, he gets along really good with other dogs and is overall a very easygoing guy. Considering he is not a special breed nor a small dog, he hasnât had any luck finding a home and Iâm sure he would adjust really well to any family that might adopt him.

Terra is 2-years old, up to date on shots, neutered, great with dogs and all people (cats unknown). He has no food or toy aggression and has experience walking on a leash.

Arya, a sweet as pie 1.5 year old, 40-45 lbs. Shepherd mix gal, arrives in NYC on 12/28 from Lebanon. She is houetrained, great with cats and dogs and all people, is spayed and up to date on shots as well as chipped. We say she's near 100% perfect!! 

Arya's Backstory from her Lebanon rescue team: Arya is a very sweet dog, rescued when she was approx. 4-5 months old. She was dumped by someone who had bought her thinking she was an 'Akita'. That person, who then realized she wasn't, took her to a clinic to cut her ears 'aesthetically' to give her a more 'dangerous' look, and then ended up tying her in front of a small shop, saying he would keep her there for a couple of hours. He never came back.

Arya has been nothing but sweet since we took her. Calmer than most dogs, she blends perfectly among other dogs. She is shy but not scared. Likes to be surrounded by other dogs, yet isn't big on participating in hectic dog play. It's been around 1 year now, and we still haven't received any application for her, although we always get comments from people saying how gorgeous she is. 

She never went to a foster home, but she's been in a boarding facility, chilling in the sun most of the day, and sleeping alone in a fenced little space at night, without bothering anyone. She is still young and seems to have lost her sparkle with time, which is why we think she deserves the chance of being noticed and chosen by someone who will show her how special she is, treat her with love and give her the right attention.

Please consider adopting sweet Arya, and watchd as those eyes light up as she discovers her very own loving furrever home...she'll repay with unending love and affection!

IÂ was born in 2008 and even though I am super playful, I am crate trained too (but would need some outdoor time for playfulness);  get along with people large or small as long as they are loving and want to play, but I would probably do better in a home without really small children because they might not be able to keep up with my energy.

178,Baby,"Shepherd, Mixed Breed","Leo is an 8-month old boy from Thailand who was rescued after he was hit by a car and lost function of his back legs due to a spinal injury.  He has just received a wheelchair in Thailand, which cuts down tremendously on expenses when he arrives in NYC, and will be headed to the East Coast in mid-November.  Here are some videos of him in Thailand before getting fitted for his wheelchair (first week of November 2018):  https://www.amazon.com/photos/share/PZqnAH3X2OnIMqQ4gd7sHJsxvmoZ00zrw6LgNx8sB9F

Leo will be practicing with his wheelchair in early November in Thailand before he comes to us, so we are hopeful that he will get the hang of things and learn how to use his chair with confidence.  He has a very sweet and gentle nature and would be a good fit for any home--a home with one person, a couple, a family with children, or a family with other furry companions. 

I speak from experience when I say that caring for a disabled pet, while challenging at times, is a very special experience and not as hard as I thought it would be.  The love you receive in return for giving a special needs animal a second lease on life is more of a payment than you will ever need.  We have no doubt that whoever takes Leo will feel the exact same way. 

We are desperately looking for either a foster home or an adopter for when Leo arrives, as we have no shelter and rely upon foster homes to help us to save these little lives.

179,Baby,Mixed Breed,"Elska is an 8-month old pastel brindle/tiger striped Thai pup who arrived in NYC at the end of September and adjusted to city life in a matter of a couple of days.   After being abandoned on the streets of South Thailand with her brother and sister (who have already come to NYC this past summer and been adopted), she was taken in and has lived with other dogs, cats, and multiple humans and has shown that she can adjust well and enjoy life to the fullest. 

Elska would be a good companion to any dog that is not aggressive, and she also needs a pack leader, as she looks for guidance and instruction.  She learns quickly and is very outgoing, playful, and loving.  She has some cat experience and can do okay with cats if introduced properly.

180,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Shepherd","Sanders is a lovely lady who is extremely friendly and cuddly.  She gets along well with humans and with other dogs (but can get a little timid and defensive if too many dogs come at her at once, so she needs to be introduced to dogs one by one).  She is approximately 3-4 years old and weighs 16 kg. 

Sanders was own by a Japanese ex-pat in Thailand, who dumped her after she moved.  She was then taken in by someone who kept on trying to breed her;  all but one of her puppies (Greenley, her son who is also up for adoption) were poisoned, as this is the fate of many dogs in Thailand who are not kept exclusively indoors.  A rescuer negotiated her and her son's freedom, as she knew they would both eventually be poisoned as well if she didn't get them out of their situation.  Despite all she went through Sanders is a very content and friendly girl.  You would never know she had such a painful past.

185,Adult,"Beagle, Golden Retriever","Diamond was rescued off of the streets of Thailand 2 years ago after local residents tried to poison him.  He was taken in by a rescuer, who, due to lack of adoptive homes, boarded him for the past 2 years!  We found out about his story in August of 2018 and wanted to help, and had him transported to NYC from Bangkok at the end of September so that we can find this boy a loving, forever home on the East Coast. 

He is a mix of beagle and Golden, and is an all-around great boy--active, playful, affectionate, and loyal.  We know that Diamond would be an asset to any home that would welcome him.  He is 45-50 lbs., and would like to be the only pet in his household, walks very well on a leash, and is very active.  He is approximately 4 years old.  

We are desperate for a permanent home for Diamond.  Since arriving in NYC at the end of September 2018, we have had a lot of inquiries for him, but we need someone with experience and preferably a single person or a couple (or one person with one roommate) to adopt him.  We don't believe he'd do well in a large household with many roommates or family members.  He wants to focus on his 1-2 humans and be a loyal companion and take long walks with his special humans.  He has shown some aggression to those who have not handled him correctly, understanding that he is territorial and must be properly introduced to new people who are entering his home, understanding that petting him while he is eating a special bone or treat will agitate him, and understanding that he doesn't want his space, home, and possessions to be threatened.  So, we need an adopter who can handle a territorial dog, and the benefit is that he will protect you and your home as his first priority.

If thatâs not the face of everything good like kindness, devotion, and wet nosed kisses... then that face doesnât even exist. This almost year old yellow lab mix is the sweetest. Molly is great with other dogs, friendly with everyone, and cuddly but not needy. Sheâs fully housebroken and sheâll probably be in the 40s or 50s weight wise full grown, and sheâd do best in an active yet gentle home.

Her foster mom says: âMolly is just about everything you could ask for in a dog. Energetic, beautiful, as friendly as they come (especially with other doggy friends!), and full of personality. Molly is potty trained, sits, stays, and gives paw on command and is SUPER food-motivated, so the sky is the limit for her training. People are always shocked to hear sheâs still a puppy because she is so well-behaved. Molly is about maxed out in terms of size but will likely put on 5-10 more pounds. Sheâs basically a half-sized yellow lab! Molly has a bit of an independent streak which I find really attractive in a dog - with a soft spot to lay and a toy to chew sheâs occupied for hours - but makes her occasionally stubborn on her leash. Sheâs improving everyday so I know her future adopter will have no problem! Molly would likely be classified as âhigh energyâ but that shouldnât deter anyone whoâs interested in adopting! She needs about an hour of mental/physical exercise and then sheâs fine to chill at home alone or with you at work during the day. Regardless of exercise, she sleeps like a ROCK through the night and has the most adorable snore. She would be the perfect addition to any kind of active household.â

197,Baby,"Shepherd, Hound","CARAWAY is a great big goofy baby with a heart of sugar. This lovely hound mix is about 7 months old, 35 lbs, and a little bit of a nervous nelly in the city but charms the socks off of everyone she meets. Caraway is a super smart fast learner, excited to meet new friends at every turn, will probably be in the 40s weight wise full grown, and needs to be in an active home ideally with another dog to play with and to guide the way. Her foster mom says: âCaraway is a sweet energetic puppy. She was very nervous when she left her last foster parent, but she settled in immediately at our home. She befriended our big dog, Bronx, and they have been the best of buddies. She had some bad habits like counter surfing that we are working on, and she is about 90% potty trained. She has learned to sit, stay, come, and working on retrieving. She has learned to sit and wait for her breakfast and dinner. She will wait for food until released with the word 'free.' It has been helpful for her to learn by watching Bronx, as he is well trained. She is very curious around our cat, Lila. I hope to get a photo of the two of them soon. She has some separation issues at the moment but I think that with time she will feel more secure. She is crate trained at night to sleep. She loves to cuddle and will fall asleep almost immediately. She spent the Thanksgiving holidays with us and was affectionate with everyone who visited. She loves to be picked up for some reason and cuddled but I try not to make a habit of it. She is going to make a family really happy.â Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org!

ARIEL... this 15 lb shortie is Dachshund all the way â driven, a little bossy, loves to chase small animals, huge personality on tiny legs. This sweet 8-year-old is no spring chicken, but sheâs got lots of spunk and is looking to land the best possible home for her retirement... when she eventually slows down. Donât get us wrong, Ariel is pretty low key indoors and likes to spend her days napping and hanging with her people and doggy foster sister. But when itâs time for a walk, she looses her cool at the sight of a leash and jumps up and down in the most adorable way â she doesnât get much air, but she gets an A plus for effort. She really enjoys walking, and her hound nose can make her a little stubborn on walks because she wants to do things her way, but she has great stamina. Ariel was pretty chubby when we first took her in, which is super bad for long low dogs, but exercise has helped her start to slim down. Ariel is great with both small and large dogs but comes on too strong for/wants to eat our feline friends. This girl is potty trained and well behaved, and in the last few days her foster mom has caught her strutting around the house with toys in her mouth â and itâs pretty fricken adorable.

He loves to bond with special humans and would do best in a medium active home. His foster mom has only had him 24 hours and says: ""Oso has kind eyes that draw you in for a wet nose kiss! He is super quiet and enjoys being perched up on the window sill to people watch and get familiar with the New York sounds. When heâs not on watch, heâs curled by your side â still alert, half asleep just in case thereâs a new sound he hasnât heard before and he doesnât want to miss it! Heâs still getting the hang of dog toys and the comfort of a dog bed but a soft blanket on the couch will do the trick. He is great on a leash, will either trail by your feet or eagerly strut in front when itâs not crowded. Oso loves to meet new people, he is comfortable with men and women, heâll take all of the rubs he can get. He seems housebroken with only a few accidents so far, and he mostly holds it until we get outside."" Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org!

201,Baby,Chihuahua,"TEDDY!! This 7-month-old, 9 pound chocolate and cream Chihuahua is a pearl onion with his littleness and his layers, and heâs worth the journey. At first, Teddy can be skittish if he doesnât know you, but heâs all yours once he does. He hails from SoCal so heâs still getting use the Big Apple bustle, but heâs adjusting pretty well and would ultimately probably do best with a quiet grownups only lifestyle. Heâs a little picky with other dogs but a sweetheart with the ones that rub him the right way. He seems especially scared of men, sadly indicating heâs probably had some not so nice dudes in his life, but heâs coming around and just needs a little time and training to get confident. Teddyâs foster mom says: âTeddy is a cute and spunky little loveball who loves to cuddle and play. He is so happy to learn new tricks and perform them for treats and praise. He knows sit, down, stay, touch, and is currently learning to bow. We are working on perfecting getting house broken and anxiety. He is still extremely nervous with new people, but don't let that scare you away. Once he gets to know you, he is the cutest pup around! He'll sleep at your feet and follow you from room to room to make sure you're doing okay! My guess is he would probably be happiest in a calm home with no kids or other pets.â Interested in adopting? Please fill out an application at www.socialteesnyc.org

217,Senior,"Chihuahua, Pug","My name is MARLEY and I'm an adorable 8/9 yr M Tan ""Chug"" (Chihuahua/Pug) X. I am 18 lbs of PURE CHUG O' LOVE BUG! I was surrendered by my owners due to ""medical issues"" as I have epileptic seizures currently in control with medication. Other than my seizures, I'm an absolutely amazingly sweet loving easy-going carefree boy that just wants to hang out with you! I've got the most endearing snaggle tooth crooked jaw that will make you just smile and laugh. I'm great with all dogs & cats but bc of my medical condition I should not be with young children as I need a QUIET HOME with not alot of traffic/activity. I would love to be with someone who works from home or is home most of the time in the event I have a seizure and I need to be held and comforted as it passes. My seizures have been fairly infrequent but as I get older I need someone to really take the time to be there for me. I am SUCH A GREAT SILLY BOY!! Just full of SH*TS AND GIGGLES!!! and such a LOVER BOY! 
If you are able to provide me with what I need, pls come meet me today!

218,Adult,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Pit Bull Terrier","My name is KORA and I'm a sweet adorabull 4/5 y F Blue/White Amstaff/ Pit X. I'm a chubby 60 lbs of PURE SMILIN SUNSHINE. I was given up by my owner due to housing issues and although I'm sad to leave, I'm ready for a new adventure with a big smile on my face. I'm a silly friendly chunky mama who is just sooo"" fun loving"" and ""happy go lucky""! I'm a positive girl and am always smiling! My only vice is that I wasn't socialized properly with other dogs as a puppy, so I'm very fearful of the unknown and I'm not fond of other dogs esp while on leash. My owner was working with me on my social manners on the street and I was starting to get more comfortable but I'm going to need more work on this.. so I need to be a SOLO DOG and with someone who has had previous experience with Pitbulls, Bully Breeds. I would prefer to live in the country as opposed to the city as that would help my anxiety with other dogs. I'm sorry but I'm not fond of cats either and since I'm a big girl it would probably be best if I went with older kids ages 10 yrs+. I could also use some more leashtraining and I'm not crate trained.. but I'm housebroken, know basic commands, don't have separation anxiety, am not destructive, only alarm bark and love to lounge on the couch with you! I'm a GEM OF A DOG, a VELCRO DOG and will stick to you like glue!! If you're looking for a LOYAL BFF.. I'm you're GIRL!! Come meet me today!!

I'm a sweet silly, friendly, super fun loving girl and just full of ""happy happy joy joy"" energy. I'm such a darling compact little munchkin but don't be fooled as I'm very strong and a muscle girl!. I do pull a bit on the leash and will need further leash training. I especially love other dogs and will always pull to them to say hello. I love balls and esp love to fetch them so be careful when walking me by a basketball court! I'm a medium energy girl so I'm great to go jogging with or for long walks and a romp at the dog run. Since I'm a bit of a bruiser, it's best if I go with older kids ages 7 yrs+ and I'm good with dogs but there are a few dogs that I'm not fond of so a meet/greet would be necessary. I haven't met any cats yet but I think I would probably leave them alone I'm good in the house and can be left home alone with no separation anxiety.. but I hate being crated and I need a nice comfy bed/couch to lounge on! In the home I'm so well behaved and my favorite thing is to just snuggle up next to you on the couch. I'm a perfect apt sized dog but I also would love a yard to run around in and fetch all day as well. I'm just the SWEETEST LITTLE WUGGIE!  Come meet me today!!

I was surrendered by my owner due to NO TIME. I'm a medium to high energy girl bc I'm still young and have silly puppy manners. I like to jump up on new folks to greet them and I pull and zig zag on the leash and I'm a little boisterous pushy when meeting other dogs. I'm not great with small dogs at first and esp if they are fluffy and fast... I do like to chase them so NO SMALL DOGS or CATS for me. Although I'm being fostered with a small long haired chihuahua in a small apt and I'm starting to get used to him and becoming buddies so it just takes time. I'm a sweet loving friendly silly loyal girl. I would be best with another big male playful dog and with someone who is medium active, knows and appreciates my breed.

221,Young,"Mastiff, Hound","My name is DINO aka BUDDY and I'm a handsome 1.5 yr M Tan Hound/Mastiff X. I'm 70 lbs of PURE DREAMBOAT!! I was rescued from a kill shelter and what a save I was! I'm a gorgeous boy with dreamy bedroom eyes. SOOO SWEET but   very very hand shy. My previous owner was not very nice to me because I don't trust hands and I will duck away from them when you try to pet me. You have to give me time to warm up to you and then I'll let you pet me. I'm still young and am still very puppylike.. I'm curious about everything and very silly, clumsy and goofy. As most puppies do, I like to chew on shoes and other hard plastic items and get into the trash if it's out. I'm very playful and love to play ""catch me if you can"" I LOVE LOVE LOVE other dogs and will pull you across the street to greet them. I definitely need more leash training because I pull like a horse. Since I""m so shy and skittish, young kids make me nervous and jumpy so older kids ages 11 yrs + would be best. I'm fine with cats but I really MUST BE with another dog to feel more secure and to pal around with. I love to run in the grass so a fenced in yard would be wonderful!! I'm a SILLY GOOSE who has ALOT of potential to become a REGAL PRINCE of a dog with someone who has the patience, compassion and easy going fun loving attitude to forgive me for my ackwardness and give me the support I need to be a more confident dog.  I will be your loyal ""Buddy""  for life!!

223,Senior,"Terrier, Chinese Crested Dog","Meet Jenny and Missy

They were pulled from local shelter where they found themselves brought in as âstraysâ . They seem to be mother daughter or sisters we are unsure but are bonded. Both are very very sweet.

Jenny is about 10ish and is both visually and hearing impaired. She has some arthritic issues as well but is very content walking around the yard a bit and laying in the sun. She seems to be a Chinese crested powder puff., a very sweet little girl.

Missy is younger- maybe 8 or so; she is a bit more active than Jenny but again, very very sweet. She too enjoys her time in the yard and enjoys spending time with Jenny. She is a bit more playful than Jenny. Both are as sweet as can be. She is a mix. Missy will be having her eye removed next week.

They are bonded and cannot be separated. They would do best with someone home during the day who can give them the TLC they deserve at this point in their lives. Neither of them like the camera!!

They would do best with a yard.

224,Adult,"American Bulldog, Staffordshire Bull Terrier","Meet BARLEY>>>>>

4.5 year old Staffie/American Bull dog mix. He weighs 50 lbs, is neutered and utd on his shots.

His dad for his whole life was going to euthanize him because Barley did not get along with his new wife or her dog. His dad had nowhere to turn as Barley is not a dog for everyone. He would do best in a home with no children and probably would do best with no other animals. He is dog selective. Although we know he was going to be a difficult placement, we took Barley in as to euthanize him was not an option. He has been with a wonderful behaviorist who has had the opportunity to get to know him and work with him.

He is happy and friendly dog but likes his space. He is not aggressive but will let you know when you are in his space. He is 100% housebroken and crate trained, plays well and gives up his toys when asked. He is not dog aggressive; he is more dog neutral. He would prefer not to interact with them.

Barley is a great housedog. He has had no issues being left alone and has shown to be reliably housebroken. He is crate trained and loves his crate. He loves hanging out, curling up and napping while you are watching TV; he will play ball or frisbee if invited and plays very politely. He is not at all demanding of your time or attention, rather he politely accepts it when offered. He used to hike and bike with his former guardian and he loves kayaking (had his own lifejacket). He is built for it (on the small side for this type of dog and muscular). He pulls a little on the leash initially, but after 15 feet or so, slows down and walks nicely. He has a happy, goofy side when playing- which is very sweet. He just needs that right person who will understand who he is and what he needs- and he will be the best friend ever.

This 3-year-old boy loves and adores his family, but has to be the only dog. He just wants to run and play, he's a little clown-like when he plays, Jo Jo is very cute. He also does not trust strangers right off the bat, takes a little time, so we know this is a difficult adoption. He will be very faithful to his family.

227,Adult,Labrador Retriever,"Rocko is a super friendly Lab mix, about 45 pounds, 41/2 years old. He has had the good fortune of knowing one loving home his entire life and it shows in his personality.

Rocko loves going for car rides and spending time in the dog park. He is well socialized, great with people and very friendly towards other dogs, he is good with indoor cats as well. He loves to play and run around outside, a well fenced in yard is a must.

He has been very well cared for and is well trained. He does have a poultry allergy managed quite well with a specific diet, but is otherwise very healthy. He is neutered, up to date on his shots. He is a sweet, goofy, energetic, happy boy, who loves life.

He needs a new family to love and for them to love him back. His family is heartbroken they can no longer keep him. Anyone would be lucky to have Rocko in their lives.

I was surrendered by my owner because I got too protective of her as she was pregnant and I was snippy snappy with those that came too close and she didn't know how to handle me and was worried that when the baby arrived I would get snarky with the baby.. little did she know that all I needed was someone to give me a correction and tell me to back off;  but alas she gave up on me but it's ok bc I'm ready for a second chance and a new life adventure. My foster mom has had no issues with me as she knows my breed and knows I have a ""napoleon"" complex but she is  very firm in correcting me when I get snarky with strangers that come to the door so I'm learning quickly. On the street I'm fine with people, dogs and kids... but if someone does approach me too heavy handed or is threatening I will get snarky.. but I've never bitten anyone and I back off with correction.  She says I'm a love in the home and I'm a wonderful loyal companion and  snuggle with her every night. I'm a medium active dog, housebroken and leash trained. I'm good with dogs, never met a cat and ok with kids ages 10 yrs+ but I think I'd prefer to be a solo dog. I'm a darling sweet silly boy and just need someone who knows my breed and is willing to be firm and continue with the training my foster mom is giving me.

Unfortunately I am being rehomed due to a ""child conflict"". I'm a silly lively little girl with delightful butterfly ears that make me look like I can fly away at any moment!  I am a bit nervous/anxious with strangers,  but once I know you I am your shadow. I may be a little munchkin but I am strong as a tank so I still pull on the leash a bit. On leash, I am reactive to other dogs because of my nervous/anxious energy but it's manageable and I will need further training on this... but I am fine with dogs off leash because I go to doggie daycare daily. I know basic commands: sit, stay, lay down and go to bed. I'm a good listener and quick learner and always up for more training. I would be best with older kids ages 12 yrs+ or an ADULT ONLY home. I seem to be better with larger calm dogs rather than small dogs that have frenetic/hyper energy but I think I would do best as a SOLO DOG. I've never met a cat but I lived with birds that flew around and I never chased them so I think I could be with a dog friendly cat.  I would also love to be in a home with a yard so I can run and get my ya yas out because I'm a good fetcher and love to do zoomies!! Inside the home,  I'm a total couch potato and love to snuggle up next to you on the couch!.

242,Adult,Chihuahua,"Cheerio is a 10-lb., approximately 1-year-old chihuahua mix who has been through a lot in his young life. He was surrendered to the city shelter when his family could no longer care for him. (He was said to have lived happily with a nine-year-old and another small dog.) 

Cheerio was very scared in the shelter - he made friends but would lie on his side, rub himself on the ground and whine from stress - and was set to be put down when Waggytail stepped in. In foster he has blossomed with a gentle approach, into a joyful pup who loves to play fetch with his squeaky ball (which he carries out to the yard!), and to carouse with two small doggie housemates. He has taken the subway without issue, content to snooze in his carrier and stick his head out once in a while for a peek, and even sat calmly on the vet's exam table on his first visit. He loves walking in the park, stops once in a while to take in the scenery, and is learning to sit for treats in order to curtail his excitement at seeing kids, runners and dogs on the street. 

Cheerio is housebroken if kept on a regular schedule. He has a mild heart murmur that currently needs no treatment and has had no effect on his lust for life. His human and canine foster family love him, and hope he finds a home that introduces him slowly to more new experiences so his awesomeness can continue to unfold.

Cheerio is up-to-date on shots, heartworm-negative, microchipped, neutered.

243,Adult,Poodle,"Richie is a 4yo, 15lbs, male Poodle mix who came to us from the city shelter. Richie's owner had to surrender him because they couldn't take care of him anymore.

Rich is an energetic and happy boy, and always always always up for a game of fetch! Richie loves going on walks but needs a little bit of leash training because he gets so excited he tends to zig zag all over the place and can get reactive sometimes. He's very smart and his new owners will likely have a lot of success training Richie to do all sorts of tricks. He loves to snuggle in the couch with his foster parents! He's a total sweetheart as soon as he knows that he can trust you. 

Richie's totally adorable and he's really very sweet. He just needs a little patience and owners who will meet him where he is. 

Richie is up to date on shots, microchipped, and will be neutered as part of the adoption.

This little elf is on the shy side and needs some time and space to warm up at his own pace, but once you win his heart, he'll be your loyal shadow. He gets an A+ for peeing on his puppy pads, but we're still working on making sure that's where we poop, tooâbut I'd say he's at a solid B+ and improving! So far, Jinx hasn't gone to the bathroom outside, but he does enjoy going for walks and is good on a leash. When you pet his head he'll close his eyes and totally bliss out.

Jinx is a curious pup who loves to explore and sniff out the whole world. He's chill and calm when it comes to meeting new dogs and people, and gets along well with his foster sister, but he will do best in a home without young children. Jinxie is vaccinated, micro-chipped, and neutered.

249,Adult,Yorkshire Terrier,"Jerry is an 8 year old, 10lb Yorkie! 

Jerry enjoys going on walks and is well behaved on the leash. Jerry might take a while to warm up to new people so he would be best in a quiet environment with NO children and not too much interaction with people. Once he warms up to you he loves his belly rubs and getting petted but only by people he knows. Although he doesnt like when strange people try to pet him, he will take treats gently from new folks. 

Jerry has some issues resource guarding toys so we would recommend that he not be allowed to have them, with gradual introduction with positive reinforcement that it's good to share. He is treat motivated so he think with work she should be able to overcome this. We would recommend an all adult home with experienced adopters willing to give him the time and attention he deserves!

Jerry is up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered. He has also had a dental cleaning.

250,Adult,Chihuahua,"Meet Butterscotch! This 12-pound female is around 5 years old, and came to NYC from LA.

Butterscotch is sweet and cuddly but also super friendly and energetic. She was so excited for her first walk in the city and was happily checking out everything, especially the new smells. She can apparently jump pretty high, too! Butterscotch runs and leaps into people's arms - pretty impressive trick! This overall happy girl who bonds quickly to her human, and loves sitting in their lap. She gets along with her foster sibling dogs, but outside is sometimes afraid of large dogs. 

It would be great if she got a little leash training though as she needs to mind her manners. Once she's in a stable environment it will all fall in to place and the bit of separation anxiety she has will dissapate. She knows how to use a pee pad and needs a little coaching on how to go outside on walks. She's a good girl who needs a good home.

263,Young,"Boxer, Shepherd","*** check out the video of Kandy with her foster bff, she's a gentle girl ***

You may remember Kandy - our volunteer partner learned about her after she gave birth to 3 beautiful babies on an abandoned lot. This beauty was surviving on her own for quite some time.  We found out from neighborhood people that, that was Kandy's 3rd litter on that lot!    All of her babies found loving homes, now it's her turn.  

As a mama dog Kandy was the sweetest girl, very easy, allowing humans to touch and pick up her babies.  That sweetness is still there - she never met a person or dog she didn't like and her love for humans has no bounds. Taking photos of her is was not easy because she just wants to be next to you all the time, she's so cute!  Kandy's foster family consists of many dogs, two adult humans and a grandmother, and she's so gentle with all.    

Her foster mom states: Kandy is calm, relaxed, loving, playful, respectful girl, gets alone very well with other dogs, excellent pet for a person who's looking for a walking/exercise companion.  Kandy also fits well for a family a little more sedentary and can be the only pet in the house. She can also live in an apartment or house.  She loves being inside the house lying in her bed enjoying the air conditioning. She loves to jump in the car and behaves very well. She is a happy dog, smart and with so much love to give. She love to chew antlers to keep her entertained and loves to fetch and enjoys playing with brightly colored toys! She has learned some commands such as sit and give paw. She relieves herself outdoors and it crate trained too.  

Kandy is 2-3 years old, 50-pounds, spayed and vaccinated and utd.  For more information and how to adopt her email Patricia: patricia.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com

Hi everyone! Iâm Rumple and I am a chill older dude looking for a quiet home to relax in. I was found wandering the streets of NYC with no collar or tags. I was brought to the city shelter but when no one claimed me, Animal Haven decided to take me into their care.

Although I may look âtoughâ with my home-cropped ears, I am really just a gentle giant in need of love.

Despite his tough looks, scars, and home-cropped ears, Rumple is a gentle, affectionate sweetheart. He is a short, squatty, 9 year old, 70 pound bundle of love.

Hi! My name is DJ and I am a sweet Dalmatian mix entering my senior years. I grew up in San Diego, CA and then moved to NYC in 2011 with my person. I wasnât easy to walk on a leash and we had a really small apartment. She could see that this wasnât the best situation for either of us. So she found me what had the potential to be a great new home in Brooklyn with a family that had a house with a yard, just like I was used to in California.

Unfortunately, 5 years later, just this past May, they abandoned me by tying me to a pole in Brooklyn. Because Iâm microchipped and my original person never changed the contact information, I was reunited with her. But same situation â she travels a lot and has a small apartment, so she brought me to Animal Haven so I can find a great home to spend the rest of my life in.

I get along well with people, kids, and other animals! Donât you want a laid-back family dog with a face like this in your life?",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41706988/1/?bust=1527101377,DJ,41706988,M,M,A

Hello, my nameâs Jamai, and I was rescued from the dog meat trade in Thailand. Because they were raising me to be a meal, and not a pet, I havenât had much socialization in my early life. And because of that, Iâm very nervous and not so sure how to accept love from humans. But the people at Animal Haven have been really nice to me, and the training staff is working on getting me used to being around people. And they feed me cheese! Yum. I think I might be on my way to liking people, but itâs going to take a whole lot of patience from the humans in my life, as I learn to love.

Hello! Iâm Sasha. Iâm an adolescent girl who thinks just about anything is fun! At first glance, people will notice what a slim girl I am. Iâm naturally skinny with long legs. Iâm still looking to learn some new tricks and people to meet. I will do best in a home with no other dogs.

Here is what Animal Havenâs trainer has to say about me: 

Sasha is a young, playful, active and affectionate girl.  She loves people and is very snuggly once she is properly exercised.  She would do best in an experienced, adult-only household as the only animal.  She is very easy to motivate and train, and with structure and consistency does quite well in a home.  She can be selective with dogs, which makes walking her a full-focus activity (no texting and walking!).  We have been training her to lessen her reactivity and sheâs made progress but will need someone who is committed to continuing her training plan and helping manage her environment on walks to help keep her feeling safe.  She would also benefit from someone who is very active â if youâre looking for a jogging partner, Sasha is your girl!  She loves to play tug and fetch and has learned âdrop itâ on command.  She also benefits greatly from daily mental enrichment, such as puzzle food toys, to keep her occupied and work her brain.  Donât worry â weâll give you plenty of trainer support and help with all these things.  In return, she will be an adventurous companion and people will stop you on the street to compliment how stunning and unique she is!

She has been in and out of homes the last 6 years due to her adopters circumstances changing.  She has been in a home with children 8-10 yrs old, and has been wonderful with the children, but very protective of them when it comes to people who do not live in the home. For that reason we are looking for an adults only home. She is getting very depressed living in a kennel atmosphere. Our hearts are breaking that this beautiful girl canât seem to find her person/family.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32875512/1/?bust=1438747913 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32875512/2/?bust=1438747914 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32875512/3/?bust=1438747914 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32875512/4/?bust=1498598267 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32875512/5/?bust=1498598267,Kimmie,32875512,F,L,A

300,Adult,Maltese,"Carter is a 9 year old/10 pound Maltese who was surrendered by owners who no longer had time for him, though he'd been with them from puppyhood. 

Carter is very attentive and likes to be with his person as much as possible.  He also gets along well with other dogs - in fact, he is currently living with 4 other Maltese dogs in his foster home.  Carter blends smoothly right into his foster home's dog pack, and is even respectful to the blind, growly, curmudgeonly dog in that group who is not very respectful to him.

Carter LOVES his walks and LOVES running and playing in the yard.  He also LOVES to play with stuffed toys - they are his very favorite thing.  If you ask him where his toy is, he will race off and joyfully bring one back to you - it is so cute!

Carter also LOVES to cuddle, and hopes for a home where cuddling is on the daily activity agenda.

In his foster home, Carter has an adorable habit when his foster mom comes home - he greets her happily at the door, and then races to a footstool and jumps up on it, just sitting and posing.  We don't know why he does this, but it is a consistent habit and it is really endearing.

As cute and appealing as Carter can be, he also has some quirks, probably originating from former abuse.   Carter is head-shy so is not a huge fan of having his harness placed over his head, and he can be afraid of being pet by new people - though this is NOT always the case - at other times he is just fine with new people petting him.  Carter is also a challenge to groom, as he is very fearful of the brush though he is great about taking baths.  Slow, reward-based acclimation to grooming tools will need to be worked on.  Carter does have silky, thick hair, but he doesn't mat easily, so that helps avoid the frequency of needed brushing.

Carter is trained to do his business both outdoors and on a weewee pad, but like many dogs might need re-enforcement when he is uprooted into his forever home.

If you are a dog owner who likes to play and cuddle while helping their dog reach attainable milestones, maybe Carter is the dog for you!  Please submit an adoption application, found on Metropolitan Maltese Rescue's website, and make sure you let us know that you are interested in Carter!

Carter is best homed in a country or suburban setting (he loves to run in the yard!), sans children.  He may work well in a city setting as well, if he has good access to dog parks.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39716091/1/?bust=1537222826 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39716091/2/?bust=1537222827 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39716091/3/?bust=1537222827,Carter,39716091,M,S,A
301,Adult,Maltese,"This adorable wide-eyed Maltese is Cooper, or Mini-Cooper as we like to call him.  He is estimated to be 6-7 years old and is 7-8 pounds.

Cooper is seeking a suburban home with a fenced-in yard.  He LOVES to be outside and LOVES to run.  And run. And run. Just like his namesake car, Cooper has a lot of energy.  He also loves other dogs, so a home where there is another dog around to play with and run with would be ideal.  Cats are fine for Cooper, too, so a home with another dog can also have cats, and he'd be fine with that!  What Cooper is not such a fan of is city life, so urban residents need not apply for him.

Those interested in Cooper should know that he is somewhat of a ""project"" dog.  He needs to gain some manners, and needs an owner who will be consistent in enforcing said manners until they become Cooper's default habit.  Currently in an apartment with a busy hallway, Cooper barks at every sound he hears outside his front door, no matter if it is daytime or the middle of the night.  In a house, this won't be as frequent or problematic of an occurrence as it is in an apartment, of course, but will still need some work.  He is also sensitive/reactive when he is in situations uncomfortable for him.  Getting positive feedback at those times will lessen his reactivity.  And again, another dog in the home will help Cooper both for fun and for acting as a role model.

Cooper has been recently neutered and had a dental, hence the cone in one of his photos, and he is ready now to be adopted.

IF you think Cooper is the dog for you, please submit Metropolitan Maltese Rescue's online application form, found on our website. www.malteserescue.com",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43277732/1/?bust=1542061685 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43277732/2/?bust=1542061687 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43277732/3/?bust=1542061688 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43277732/4/?bust=1542062998,Cooper,43277732,M,S,A
302,Adult,Maltese,"My name is Pheebs and I like leaves! True. Never met one I didnât want to sniff. And you know whatâs even better? A pile of them! In that case, I like walking, and sometimes jumping, in them. I guess you could say Iâm a bit of a goofball. 

I also really love being as close as possible to my human. I can only see well-ish out of one eye, so I easily bump into things and scare myself. So, I prefer to stick with a sighted human for guidance and help.

My favorite time is the morning, or on a walk. But really anytime I get to spend with my human makes me incredibly happy. Iâm easy that way. 

My foster mom has been impressed with how patient, sweet and kind I am. Iâve never met a dog, cat or human I havenât liked. I was found as a stray, and was very frightened at the shelter, but once I grew comfortable in my new home, I became a world class snuggler. My foster mom even bought me a bag to carry me around and that may be where Iâm most content. 

 In general, I know where to do my business and go right away on my walk. Since Iâm a bit older,  and can get confused, I can have the occasional accident. My foster mom uses a belly band if she thinks Iâll forget my manners. Other than that, my foster mom gives me a five star rating!

As for ""forever home"" preferences, I would truly love to be with someone who works from home, so we could be together a lot - but it is not required.    And no kids under the age of 6, please.  

If you think Iâd be a good fit in your life, Iâd love to find my forever family for the holidays.  Please submit Metropolitan Maltese Rescue's online application form, found on our website: www.malteserescue.com.  MMR will work hard to make my 'home for the holidays' wish come true.

303,Adult,Bichon Frise,"Humphrey is an 8 year old, 9lb Bichon Frise.  He is a happy, healthy, friendly and loving dog who just wants to cuddle, play (note his video), and be with his person (note his napping photo!)

Humphrey likes treats and walks and cuddling with or following his person around. He eats a regular diet and is housebroken to the outside.  He will sometimes bark if he hears someone walking by the door, but is generally quiet. He will growl a little if another dog tries to take his food or toy from him but shows no signs of aggression at all.  

Humphrey is a happy and very affectionate dog jumping into laps, giving kisses and wanting belly rubs.  He will a wonderful, loving  companion.  What Humphrey really does NOT like is being in a city environment, so we are seeking a suburban or country home for him, where he will be comfortable..

If you think Humphrey could be YOUR loving companion, please submit an Adoption Application to Metropolitan Maltese Rescue.  The form can be found on our website.

304,Senior,"Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier","This is no Diamond in the rough, she is everyoneâs perfect pup! At around 11 years old (although she acts much younger) and about 55lbs, Diamond is a lively senior lady with a lot of love to give. She bonds quickly to people and we think was a former jogging buddy. Although she has slowed down a little now, she still has enough energy to play a game of fetch or go for a hike.

She has a speckled belly, which she loves to have rubbed. Diamond is a true family dog - calm, gentle, and easy going. She has no guarding issues, walks well on a leash and is fine being left home alone to snooze on the couch. She has limited hearing, but that does not cause her any problems. She is very treat motivated, and is eager to learn new tricks. 

Diamond is a sweet lady who adores all people, and is tolerant of most dogs, although as a senior lady she would rather be an only pet or live with a similarly chill senior. She no longer has the energy or patiences for young pups and will occasionally bark at other dogs to tell them to relax. However, if they stay away from her, she has zero interest in them.

Diamond was surrendered to the city shelter after her owners moved and decided not to take her with them. She waited at the shelter for six MONTHS, constantly being over looked, despite being very popular at adoption events. Her age may have been a factor, as her owners reported she was approximately 11 years old. However, her energy level and the condition of her teeth suggest she is younger than that. Possibly closer to 7 or 8 years old. They also reported she had hearing issues, which we have seen no signs of.

See more pictures and learn more about Diamondâs story on our instagram pages @shelterchic and @shelterchicanimals. You can also see updates of her progress in her foster home @fosterpupisodes

305,Adult,"Beagle, Pug","Meet Lucy, she is around 6 years old and 30lbs. Lucy is a sweet girl looking for an active family who has time to continue her training and provide her with all the exercise she needs.

Lucy loves to run and would do well in a home with a yard for her to frolic in or someone who enjoys long walks, frequently goes hiking and on daily runs. She also enjoys swimming. She loves to play with toys, enjoys chewing on large branches and sunbathing.

Lucy would thrive in a home with experienced dog owners who have no other dogs, or only very submissive dogs. Lucy is an anxious young lady, and occasionally that leads her to make some bad decisions. However, Lucy is happy when she is on a good schedule, with a family who understands the importance of doggie rules. Lucy doesnât want to deal with the pressures of being leader of the pack, it makes her nervous, but if she has to take over, she will!

Lucy is house trained, has an incredible amount of love to give, and always has time for a cuddle. Lucy has more energy than the typical 6 year old pooch, and will need physical and mental exercise to keep her happy. Lucy currently takes medication to help with her anxiety. By consulting with your vet or taking her to see an animal behaviorist, you may be able to find other ways to help her control her anxious side. Lucy also has IBD (Irritable Bowel Disorder) which means she can only eat prescription dog food, and although she cannot have table scraps, she is a big fan of carrots and lettuce!

Lucyâs anxiety means she can be easily startled, especially when sleeping. Lucy was recently surprised by her baby brother which resulted in her snapping at him. Although the bite was superficial, we advise that Lucy not be around young children or children who can not be responsible around this little lady.

306,Senior,Labrador Retriever,"You cannot get much better than this Ace in the pack. Ace is around 8-10 years old, and 55lbs. Although he does the most amazing Elvis impression with his lip, his foster mom has endearingly nicknamed him Grandpa. Super social and happy when heâs out and about, but more than happy to spend the day napping in his favorite armchair once he gets back home.

Ace is a DREAMBOAT who we pulled from the NYC city shelter. A volunteer writes: I finally got my chance to meet Ace, a handsome and elegant gentleman, all dressed in black. I do not know if he reminds me of a knight or his ebony steed. He knew why I was at his door and in no time, we found ourselves in the street. Ace seems very housetrained. He is a steady walker, a good sitter at the lights, respectful of birds and other dogs met. I know that in our playgroups, he is polite with his peers, males and females. He enjoys his time, leash free in the yard where he poses like a star for pictures. Indeed, Ace seems naturally all dressed up for a fancy gathering and can not take a bad shot! Ace is quite dreamy here at the care center. He is polite, compliant, wags his tail, always but his thoughts are somewhere else. I am sure you know where. A home sweet home, the love of a family, that is what his heart is after. 

Although Ace shows no signs of a current injury, he is particularly sensitive to having his back legs touched. We believe this is due to some kind of physical or emotional trauma he experienced in the past. Because of this, Ace does not like to be examined or touched in that area by someone who he considers to be a stranger. However, once Ace comes to fully trust you, his anxiety about this disappears. Ace is looking for a dog savvy owner, who has the knowledge, patience and understanding to help him overcome his past and make his time with strangers and at the vet less worrisome for him. This can be achieved with positive training methods using high value treats and repetition.

Ace cannot be placed in a home with children or other pets.

307,Senior,Labrador Retriever,"Adorable, senior girl Chatrlotte, is around 12 years old and about 40lbs. Charlotte is a loving, happy-go-lucky lady who adores all people, gets on well with dogs and is even happy living with cats!

She still loves to gallop around with her doggie pals, she might even bring you back the ball if youâre lucky, but she is always available to snuggle in a blanket and take a nap on the couch.

Sweet Charlotte was originally adopted from Newark Associated Humane Societies in 2009 when she was a still practically a puppy at 3 years old. After 9 years of love and devotion, poor Charlotte ended up back at city pound when her family decided they could not care for her when she needed her most. Charlotte was the happiest dog when she walked back through those doors, just happy to go for a walk with her family. She did not realize that they would be going home without her. All the staff at the shelter were heartbroken to watch her wait by the door for their return, and they reached out to other rescues to get her back in a home as soon as possible.

Charlotte is having a wonderful time in her new foster home, and she is wagging her tail once again. Her foster mom says ""Charlotte is a wonderful, sweet old lady who acts years younger than she is. She has an adorable personality and a lot of spunk in her step. She loves all people and other animals (she wants to play with every single dog she meets). She does well with dogs and cats. We have not seen her interact with small children, but she ignores them when walking on the street. She is a snuggle bug who loves company and would love to be in a home where her people and/or other animals are home regularly to snuggle and play with her. She does well on car rides and is good on leash. She is the perfect pup and needs her perfect forever home to live the rest of her life in.â

Charlotte has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease but is responding extremely well to a prescription diet (just Hill's Science Diet k/d formula). She is fully housetrained, but does need the opportunity to relieve herself a bit more than many adult dogs (typically every 5-6 hours, though she does usually make it through the full night) due to her kidney disease. She will let you know when she needs to go to the bathroom if you pay attention to her cues.

She also has a few lumps and bumps but they have all been tested and are nothing to worry about.

308,Adult,"Chinese Crested Dog, Yorkshire Terrier","Sweet as sugar, our own little Cupcake. She is around 7-9 years old, and 15lbs. She is sweet little girl who loves to be cuddled, take lap naps or curl up on the couch to watch a movie with you. She can be a little shy at times and would not do well in a home with small children.

Tiny Cupcake was surrendered to the shelter in horrible condition. Her teeth had been terribly neglected, she had a nasty cold and her skin was flaky and itchy from poor nutrition. She seemed so scared and depressed at the city shelters, she wouldnât even lift her head.

Thankfully, after just a few day in her foster home, she has come out of her shell tremendously and is feeling so better. She is a quiet but curious girl and likes to explore the house on her own. She is being fostered with other dogs of various sizes and gets along well with them all. Cupcake is deaf and she relies on other dogs to guide and comfort her, therefore Cupcake MUST go to a home with one or more low energy, friendly dogs.

309,Adult,Shih Tzu,"Adorable Claudine, is around 10 years old and about 10lbs. Claudine is a sweet lady who adores all people, gets on well with dogs and is so low energy, she would be fine around cats.

Her foster mom say, âDescribing Claudineâs routine would literally go something like this : Waking up whenever you do, doing her business outside, eating her food with passion, and going back to sleep until it's time to do her business again a few hours later, then going back to sleep then waking up again to eat, do her business outside on a brief walk, andâ¦ Yes you guessed it, sleep again ! Sheâs not into long walks even if she seems to enjoy it. She also has done great using pads in the house and finds her way to it. Her favorite thing is really to be in her own little bed and sleep there. Itâs almost like she wants to make sure itâs always here for her to enjoy. She doesnât play with my two other big dogs despite their numerous desperate attempts her to get her to play which is the cutest thing ever to watch and sheâs not at all scared of them and never reacts to them. Iâm pretty sure she loves them in her very reserved way. She is a GREAT cuddler and will be very happy at night if you have her joining you on the couch but sheâs not demanding at all except when you get up or go back home which is when she will look for you to give you kisses, resting her little paws on your knees to reach out to your face :) Claudine is a discreet and quiet little flower, always bringing happiness in your life in a very sweet way :)â

Claudine has mammary tumors as a result of her not being spayed. Unfortunately it is impossible for us to accurately determine if these are currently cancerous. In our experience, removing cancerous lumps on very senior dogs does not prolong their life sufficiently enough to under go such a high risk surgery or the discomfort of recovery. Since the cancer causing hormones are already present in her system and causing lumps, there is no easy treatment to give her. We are therefore treating Claudine as if she does have cancer and simply giving her the best life possible.

Claudine also has limited vision.

Adopt Millie!

She was found malnourished down south and brought to a high kill rural shelter. Millie is now thriving in a foster home, however what she really wants is a forever home..

Here's what her foster mom says: Millie is very friendly and polite with all people and all dogs. Her entire body wiggles when she greets you. She doesn't jump, walks nicely on the leash without pulling and doesn't bark. Millie is very very friendly and gentle with our big cat and doesn't chase him. She gets along very well with our own dog, loves to play and takes herself into her crate for a nap or the night. She is crate trained and now potty trained as well...

Millie is wonderful and kind and extremely well behaved.
She is 3-4
years old and 50 lbs.
She really can fit into most any home. P

Teddy is a special boy and does have some special needs. He has mild Mega-esophogus which means that he needs to eat and drink from elevated bowls to help him keep his food down. No high chair is necessary for feedings. In addition, he does have a condition that is thought to be genetic and it keeps the hair from growing on his face. He takes medications for this. Use of sunscreen is a must so his skin does not get burnt, and his time in the direct sun should be limited. He is house trained, crate trained, potty trained and leash trained.

He isn't a super cuddly guy, but he lets you know he wants affection by leaning into you and tapping you with his paw. He loves biscuits, scratches behind the ear and belly rubs.

He was brought to a shelter because he developed a tumor on his leg and his owners wanted him ""disposed"" of. We weren't going to let that happen and we took him into rescue. Rock had to have his leg removed. The tumor was growing rapidly, and the biopsy showed squamous cell cancer. Because it was not taken care of when it first appeared, our vet feels the chances that it spread elsewhere is likely. We know he more than likely needs a hospice home. He gets along with all people and seems to like small dogs. Because he was so emaciated, we can only guess that he had gone without food for a long time, and he now has resource guarding issues - it will take some time for him to adjust to the fact that he no longer has to fight for scraps. He will need to be fed separately and at scheduled feeding times with no free range feeding including treats. It is recommended that he not be placed with children who will hand food or take food from him.

Darla is the sweetest and friendliest pitbull mix you'll ever meet!
She was found dumped on the side of the road in the hot Texas sun in a tub, her feet bound with a bungee cord, and her puppies in a basket beside her. Sadly, her puppies all passed away.

Born in 2015 and now weighing 50 lbs, she

is great with people of all ages and other dogs.

Her foster mom says:
""She draws attention and compliments wherever we go and can play all day or snooze all day on the couch. She loves to cuddle and loves any attention you give her, especially a game of tug of war. Darla is highly trainable and food motivated. She currently knows basic commands ""sit"", ""wait"", ""come"", and ""drop"". and would do best in a home that is medium-active in a quiet neighborhood. She is up to date on all her shots and vaccinations, and physically in great shape.

She is eager to please. Very well mannered and enjoys running errands and loves to go shopping at Loweâs where she has become a favorite!! Everyone falls in love at first sight with Alice ... canât tell if itâs her beautiful big eyes, her gentle nature or simply her loving expressions. She does well with others in the playgroups and prefers dogs with a similar demeanor.
High energy dogs need to go slow but she will warm up in a week or two and be best friends with them.
She enjoys the company of others and is just a pleasure to be with!
Alice really loves to be near her humans and does have some separation anxiety so in her new dream home it would be best if she isnât left alone for long periods of time. She would thrive in a quieter home that doesnât have a lot of people coming and going. She is highly food motivated and loves to learn new tricks.

He exhibits some anxieties when inside the home and would prefer to live in a quieter area. Rowdy absolutely loves being outside or going for car rides.

He just wants to be by your side. He has been around small children (under the age of 5), but never unsupervised. He shows a lot of playful interest in other dogs but has only had supervised play because he's a rough and tumble kind of guy. He might benefit greatly from having another dog in the home.

Meet Atticus! Atticus is a sweet and VERY playful 9 month old, 45lbs boy, who loves older (9years+) kids and other high energy, or very tolerant dogs. He is housebroken, crate trained, walks on a leash, he knows some basic commands, and will sit and wait for his food! He has no food aggression, and does not seem to be dominant when it comes to other dogs. Atticus has been living in a wonderful, loving foster home with two other dogs and a few cats. He DOES NOT get along with the cats at all. When he sees a cat he fixates and will not redirect at this time in his life; because of this he must be in a home WITHOUT cats. Atticus will do best in a home where he can have access to a high energy playmate! His ideal dog sibling will be a dog who either matches his level of excitement, or a dog that will tolerate his excitement. His current housemates are older dogs who donât always appreciate his playfulness and Atticus does not pick up on these clues. He doesnât understand that they donât want to play. This wonderful energy could be stressful to an older or less tolerant dog. Atticus embodies all of the qualities we look for in a puppy, heâs happy, loving, sweet, loves to give kisses, eager to learn, and heâs coming to know that cuddling is one of lifeâs many pleasures. He will brighten up any home with his beautiful spirit. If you are interested in adopting Atticus please go to:

451,Senior,Pit Bull Terrier,"You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Prince Argon is the most handsome 7-8 year old Pit mix that you will ever lay your eyes on! This poor boy was moments from euthanasia at a high kill shelter in Texas when one of our southern fosters got a plea and just couldnât let him face that fate. Argon has never known the perks of the âgood lifeâ and is finally starting to enjoy the simplest of things. You should see him rolling around in a soft blanket like heâs never had such comforts and a nice cozy dog bed is just about heaven to this sweet, sweet boy. Argon will get all the medical care he needs and soon will be ready for a home to call his own. His ears were very infected when we got to him and it seems to be effecting his hearing so we will be treating and monitoring this issue. He is a miracle dog, a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day, the apple in the eye of anyone that beholds him. Yes, he really is that special. He is so forgiving of all the neglect and suffering that he has endured and he has stayed strong and resilient just long enough for us to find him and start offering him some relief from his torturous past. Argon is wonderful, amazing, and deserves a forever home with the same attributes. He needs someone that can show him the finer things in doggie life and just spoil, adore, and love him unconditionally for the rest of his days. He is friendly with people of all ages and other dogs and will be neutered and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in his forever home. A home with older children would be best for Argon as even though he is an adult he has some puppy play mannerisms and is still learning how to be a dog. Cats are new for Argon as well and although he has not shown a hint of aggression he is a little too curious (who can blame him!) so a cat free home would be ideal. Are you looking for the most handsome boy to add to your family with a huge heart of gold?! Then look no further and fill out an adoption application for Argon here! Http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org

She has extensive wiring holding everything in place and although Serenity still has many obstacles to face she is a strong willed fighter and has been doing great.

She has been with foster and we would really love to find that perfect home for her. She is up to date on shots and has been spayed. She is good with other dogs. Tutti is a very timid girl, and it takes her awhile to be 'not so shy'. She needs the right home to help her learn that love is indeed forever, and that no one will ever h

She found herself at a high kill shelter in Texas with horrific burns all over her face. She was in so much agony that she couldnât even blink without causing herself pain. Because she was so unwell the shelter decided there was no choice but to euthanize her, and Lottie was given a very short deadline for rescue to step up. Of course, Rescue Dogs Rock stepped in to do just that, saving Lottie just before her deadline and arranging her transport to a vet for life-saving care.

She is a 60lb bundle of snuggles and itâs so sad to think sheâs only had ONE visit in a whole year of being in foster. Trout loves kisses, naps, playing dress-up, and generally being your spirit animal. Sheâs incredibly attentive to her people which means she is super easy to train and she listens very well; call her from across the yard and sheâll come running! She is part love bug (she lives to be on your lap), part guard dog (you will never pee alone again), and whole sweetheart (snuggles are her favorite). Trout can be anxious in trying to read other dogs body language and is calmer when on her own with her people. She LOVES attention but is just as happy if she just gets to lay near you while you watch TV (or between your feet when you cook or sit at the door while you use the bathroom or make sure youâre safe while you dry your hair....). She would do well in a house with older kids (7 and up) so she has equals and not little ones she could roll over with love bumps.

Meet Yipper! His name came with him all the way from his home state of Texas where he was living in dirt, starving outside, and fending off predators and danger at every turn. He contracted distemper, but thanks to amazing vet care and proper monitoring, he is completely cured of the disease and a happy, healthy puppy! He is 10 months old, Fully house trained, sleeps all night in his crate and loves going for long walks.

He has a super sweet personality and loves car rides! he is very food motivated and picks up on commands quickly. He would do best in a home with a yard to run and play before he comes back inside to happily chew on a bone or play with a toy. He loves all humans, big and small, and is a loyal companion. He gets along well with other dogs but would do best in a home without cats. he will acclimate so well to your home and family that you won't be able to remember life without him!

SusiQ is currently located in the 03773 area code. She is up to date on shots and good with all people and other dogs. She is most certainly a hound-mix, she loves her walks and scenting her way thru the woods. She rarely barks, but when she hears

the coyotes in the distance at night, will occasionally join in The Big Aroo. Susie Q is a country girl at heart, the city life is too overwhelming for her so a country home in a rural setting would be best. Susie is allergic to cigarette smoke so a non smoking home is a must. She is a humorous girl, a little bit in her own world, and happy to join in on any adventure or car trip you may be heading out for. SusiQ came into Rescue having great difficulty with Trust. But as she has grown to trust her foster mom, she is more bold approaching people in public, and trusting that they will treat her as her foster mom does.
If you would like to adopt Susie Q, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org 1/1/19 9:04 AM",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38347370/1/?bust=1496896039 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38347370/2/?bust=1496896039 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38347370/3/?bust=1496896039,Susie Q,38347370,F,M,A

612,Baby,Canaan Dog,"Our friends in Egypt saw this 4-month-old pup get hit by a car, I took her to a vet where it was decided she had a minor shoulder dislocation. She was taken back to the parking garage where she was found and put on meds/ vitamins for 1 week to strengthen her muscles so that she would be able to use her shoulder again. When our friends went to give her the meds, someone had chopped off her arm!  We donât know who did this or why. She is currently staying with our friends and will soon have the rest of her arm amputated. She will be able to live a normal life and despite all this, she is a very fun and loving dog, who doesnât let her disability stop her from enjoying life and getting affection. She needs a furever home with very few stairs, a loving family with time and energy for her to give her love and attention to make up for what she has been through.  Please apply today, but due to recent ban on all Egyptian Air flights carrying animals, we are not sure of arrival date at this time.

5y 38lb Zazu fka Zebracake is a good looking gent, reasonably well groomed and dressed in a lush dark chocolate and black coat. His amber eyes light up his face. His muzzle is very slightly grey, and his mouth opens often into a lovely smile. Zazu is a little shy in his kennel, but gets leashed fairly rapidly. He is a very good walker, marks a little his territory, and eyes the pigeons as well as the squirrels in the park. Well, he is just doing his job, as he is part of the herding group of dogs. Zazu does not mind being stared at by me and the camera. He will sit on command, and is not at all interested in my treats that I thought were quite tasty. He seems to like my caresses all over his body. He is a really very gentle and well-mannered pooch. As we were early visitors at a nearby park, we did not meet many dogs, and those we encountered did not elicit much attention from Zazu.  He is an easy going character, friendly, a little shyâat least inside our wallsâand a lovely Collie/Retriever mix who is sure to attract connoisseurs of the breeds.

615,Adult,"Pit Bull Terrier, Boston Terrier","HELP in Bklyn Shelter after being adopted years ago!
Maxienne now known as MaceyÂ is that perfect kind of Pitbull Boston terrier mix that thinks she is a little laptop, wanting nothing more than to curl up in your lap and snuggle up close to you all day if she could.
Maceyâs black and white coat, long pretty whiskers, and adorable big pointed ears make her not just a cute pup, but a real beauty. Unlike so many others that you cannot let off their leash in fear of them running away, Macey will go outside all on her own to do her business and then happily come right back to you, having no interest in being away from her foster mom for any longer than necessary!  Macey is the girl you can take for long hikes who will walk besides you leash-free, and then come home afterwards to curl up on the couch upon your lap, letting you know how much she appreciates you. She is a devoted girl who strides towards pleasing her owner more than anything. She is the perfect, well-behaved, house-trained dog who will complete any family. There is not one bad thing anyone could say about her and therefore deserves a home where her future owners will think nothing but wonderful things about her. She is now about 6y yound and 40 pounds.

Maxienne/Macey is a beautiful little girl at only 40lbs. She is housetrained and does wonderfully in her crate, Maxienne/Macey is a sweet girl who just wants to please everyone. She is good with all people and other dogs. She would love to just sit with her new owner and be loved. She is great on a leash and very docile. Loves to play but not an extreme bundle of energy. She would do well in any setting.

616,Young,"Basenji, Pharaoh Hound","Farhan is an 11 month-old sweetheart from Saudi Arabia, where he was an abused street dog and now blind in his left eye.
He is wary of new people because of his past, but warms up quickly. He is quite happy lounging around the house, staring out the window, playing with his toys and he LOVES playing with other dogs. He is a also a big fan of sleeping, he does that a lot after all his other activities. 
Farhan is fully house trained and would love to live in a home in a quiet neighborhood outside of the city because he's not a fan of loud noises or the hustle and bustle of NYC.  He does need another dog in his life and is better in an all female or 1 guy home.
History: Farhan is a very young acting puppy found at 2mos w/ his 4 siblings, no mom, on the side of a highway in Saudi Arabia. A little shy at first but once he determines you like him, he's your new best friend, and smart--he looks for assurance and confirmation!  He is both cat and dog social and because he has a bit of energy and loves to run w/ his doggy friends, should be in a home that can provide him access to lots of puppy playtime. He also has excellent leash manners and loves to ride in the car!   He is blind in his left eye but you would never know it either by looking at him or his behavior but we need to be careful approaching him from his blind side!  He is definitely a dog for outside the city as the noises of NYC are a bit much for him:(
Please apply for our first Saudi!

617,Adult,Chihuahua,"Meet Maggie May, a 6 to 7 year old sweet and chubby 9 lb. Chihuahua. Sheâs very good natured and affectionate, and loves to sleep with her foster dad. Sheâs a smart little girl who is learning commands, and is usually a pretty relaxed pup. Sheâs wee-wee pad trained and housebroken. She doesnât bark much, except when someone comes to the door, and is very content just hanging out. Maggie May has had all her shots, is microchipped and tested negative for heartworm. Sheâs still dieting to lose her belly weight, but is a happy girl nonetheless. However, sheâd be happier to have a forever family to love.

618,Adult,American Bulldog,"3y 65lb Bruno Brunelli is everything we love about the bully breeds: Very friendly, loose wiggly body and a waggy tail. He allowed counselor to pet him and rub his belly. He knows his commands of sit and stay. He allows all handling As per the client Bruno is house broken and friendly towards strangers. He has never bitten or scratched anyone to his knowledge. Bruno will chew up shoes if they are left out--so don't leave your shoes out as chew toys! Best in a home w/ no small children due to his energy, and because he is a big boy, w/ experienced bully adopters who know enough to be the alpha in the pack:)  He can be a bit territorial about his toys and food w/ other dogs so we think his ideal situation is a home w/ a yard and access to other doggies for playtime.  He definitely is not a city critter.  He loves puppies so we consider him the perfect puppy nanny!

A volunteer writes: Bruno is a wiggly, playful, sweet bundle of joy! He pulls a little on leash, seems housebroken, sits for treats, and manages to immediately initiate a romance with any tennis ball he finds! Iâm not sure Iâve ever met a dog who entertains himself as well!. He play bows with the ball, waltzes with it, rolls on his back with it, eventually chews it up, and then starts the whole cycle with the next one. Just watching him is enough to put a smile on anyoneâs face, but he also loves interacting with people (and, so far, other dogs too!). He seems to be one of those dogs who sees a friend in every stranger (the kind of friend he can give kisses to and get belly rubs from!), but I can only imagine the extra-special-lovinâ he has reserved for his family. 

11/08/2016 BEHAVIOR AVERAGE Client came to drop off a dog that he stated was left in his apartment by his roommate. Intact, Owner Surrender Previously lived with: Adults
SAFER ASSESSMENT: 11/8/16 Look: 1. Dogâs eyes are averted. His ears are back, his tail is down, and he has a relaxed body posture. Dog allows head to be held loosely in Assessorâs cupped hands. Sensitivity: 1. Dog leans into the Assessor, eyes soft, soft and loose body, open mouth. Tag: 2. Dog is not fearful, but is unresponsive to the Assessor, and approaches the Assessor at the end of the game (need coaxing to approach.) He is focused on stimuli other than the Assessor. Squeeze 1 & 2: 1. Dog does not respond at all for three seconds. His eyes are averted and his ears are relaxed. Toy: 1. No interest. Summary: No concerns were seen on this assessment.
DOG-DOG INTERACTION ASSESSMENT: Summary PLAYGROUP: Bruno was surrendered as a stray so his past behavior around dogs is unknown. When off leash with dogs at the Care Center, Bruno engages in gentle play with male and female dogs. He is sexually motivated but able to continue to play when solicited. The Behavior Department recommends that Bruno be placed in a home with dogs that match his gentle play style and that a dog-dog interaction be conducted to ensure compatibility. MEDICAL BEHAVIOR: 11/04/16 During his initial medical examination, Bruno readily allowed all handling without issue. ENERGY LEVEL: Bruno displays a high activity level in the care center. RECOMMENDATIONS: Average (suitable for an adopter with an average amount of experience) Note: see potential challenges section below Potential challenges: _X_Destructive behavior: Bruno is a young, active, enthusiastic dog with lots of energy. He will need daily mental and physical exercise and stimulation to channel that energy appropriately. He is also reported to chew up shoes if they are left out, so this will need to be managed in his future home.

11/05/2016 GROUP BEHAVIOR EVALUATION When off leash with dogs at the Care Center, Bruno engages in gentle play with male and female dogs.

Sultana, a 2y Shep/Canaan mix survived this horrific situation but unfortunately her puppy did not.   she was in so much pain; her leg was bleeding badly yet she stayed beside the puppy until  rescue arrived.  She lovessssssssss cats and dogs, is fine w/ adults, hasn't had any exposure to children but we are guessing her sweet nature makes her good w/ all sizes as long as the children are nice and somewhat quiet.  She is a gentle little girl, calm, quiet, friendly, and affectionate. Arriving from Kuwait Dec 28th, she needs her furever home for the New Year ideally.

She was found lying in filth in an abandoned lot, all skin and bones.  We don't have much info other than she's extremely sweet despite everything and she LOVES to play in a yard w/ other dogs.  She is a little afraid of the city so maybe a suburban home would be more to her liking.  Due to lack of good nutrition as a young pup, she is going to stay small (25lbs).

626,Young,"Shiba Inu, Canaan Dog","1y 30lb Ciara Kindly, our little mystery breed girl, Canaan Shepmix from Kuwait.  Someone brought her to an area to sell her and when he could not, he just dumped her where she was found being chased by a pack of strays.  Despite her sad beginnings, she loves other dogs, especially the boys.  We are hoping to find her a home with another young male dog to play with nearby, she loves people and would especially love it if her family were around a lot because she is super affectionate.  Please apply, she's here waiting for you.

From Ciara foster, mom-Ciara is a highly intelligent energetic Canaan mix dog.  She is alert to her surroundings at ALL times and will bark loudly to let you know.  This is a breed trait so she I just doing her job.  It is up to you to let her know you are aware and in charge of the situation.  I tell her good girl, I am on it then good girl Quiet until she calms down.  Prior to coming to us she had very little training in basic commands.  She is doing very well with
Quiet-  used above or for unnecessary barking
Come-  from short and medium distances with reward training
Sit/Stay-  from short distances with treat training.

She is fully house trained, but we had to learn her signal and only had 2 accidents.  For sure she needs to go out very first thing in the morning for #1 and 2.  She is crate trained as well and sleeps there at night.  She is extremely active and needs room to run so a fenced yard is best until she is fully trained to you.  She will let you know she is bored by whining and will go for the occasional slipper if left unoccupied.  I tell her no gently and exchange it for one of her toys.  She doesnât fully understand the concept of play yet, but is doing very well fetching her snake toy and squeaky ball.  She even brings it back to you!

She is an excellent one person dog, preferably female.  Attaches quickly and only wants to be with you and will guard you well.  Loves belly rubs and chin scratches are the best! But cats, not so much.  Will chase after anything that runs due to her high prey drive.

627,Baby,Labrador Retriever,"This 6m golden boy has been living it up in Egypt since he was found as a pup at 2m!  He is super friendly, affectionate, great on leash, house trained, affectionate w/ people and dogs...what more can we ask for?  Oh yes, a purrmanent home w/ lots of love and attention.  

From Milo foster mom


âWarning! This little pup will steal your heart and your socks!â

Milo is a sweet boy from Egypt, around 6 months and very much still a fun puppy who loves to play, chew his bone and yes, run off with discarded socks! Probably part Canaan/Labrador hound he is super affectionate and loves to snuggle and get his belly rubbed. 
Heâs a little shy outdoors if itâs busy and loud and with meeting new people at first, but in the house he is a dream and so much fun. 
Besides sock theft, he loves going on errands in the car. He will sit quite happily whilst you go into the store. He also loves looking at his reflection in the mirror, he knows heâs a handsome boy!
Heâs happy sleeping on a dog bed but loves to snuggle if you will let him on the bed. Very smart, knows âNO!â âDownâ which is when he sits and he loves hearing âGood Boyâ which is when he will show you the waggiest tail ever!
Fine with other dogs, Iâm confident he will be less shy with people he doesnât know, once heâs settled into his forever home!

Jesse is here from Egypt missing a home in time for Thanksgiving but would definitely enjoy Christmas and New Year's:) Because he is blind, we would like him to go to a home w/ a seeing female dog (Kebe was his best friend back home and she is available too) OR a cat or 2 to welcome him and show him around.  A home w/ a backyard so no leash and no stairs to navigate is his preference.  He loves his lightly cooked chicken liver mixed in his chicken and rice!  Please apply

Backstory:  he was hit on the head and made blind by a horrid rescue group in Egypt to get more money and when they jumped ship, shut down, turned all their dogs onto the streets to fend for themselves.  Luckily a reputable rescue group there stepped in and sent him to us to help.  Please donate for his care, he only eats people food and a lot!

During her stay there, she was described by a volunteer as very sweet, calm, and good on walks. Life on the streets wasn't easy for Hikari. She arrived at the shelter emaciated and missing hair on her back from malnourishment. Hikari became very sick during her stay at the shelter. Fortunately, Ready for Rescue was able to pull her to safety where she was able to receive the medical attention she so desperately needed.

Fast forward to now, where she has put on a few pounds, and has happily settled in to her new foster home. She has a new-found energy and zest for life! She loves going on long  walks with her foster dad. She is very friendly and eager to meet people out on the street.  When she's at home, she's right there willing to snuggle and cuddle with her favorite people.

Hikari is currently working on leash manners when encountering other dogs, since she tends to become excitable when she sees them.  When left home alone, Hikari is quiet and well-behaved,  She is crate trained and is well behaved when her humans are away.

Hikari would love to find her forever home and promises to make a great companion if given the chance!

640,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Terrier","My name is Lucy; I was rescued by a good Samaritan who was in the island of  Puerto Rico on a business trip.  I was tossed pregnant in the left lane (were there is no emergency lane) of a five lane highway.  I couldn't cross to safety, too many vehicles passing by.  I was against the concrete barrier that divides the north & south bound of the highway, hitting myself into the concrete barrier to avoid a vehicle from hurting me.  Until someone driving on the left lane had the heart to stop and open the door of their vehicle for me.  I was so terrified I hopped into the vehicle crying franticly.  The kind samaritan gave me water, stroked my head and immediately took me to the veterinarian.  I had blood work, was neutered & given my shots.  On the Island the shelters are overwhelmed & are euthanizing almost all pets. The kind person named me Lucy & brought me to the USA, in the hopes I have a chance of being adopted here.  I am trained to go outside, I don't hop on
the furniture,  I am friendly, loving, loyal & I'm desperately in need of a home. I would prefer one without other dogs. The kind person who saved me is overwhelmed with being the care taker of severely ill parents, several  pets,  a spouse & a job.  It's a

647,Adult,"Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel","NYC Area - Gary was chained up outside of his former owner's house in South Korea. His owner wanted to give him away to the dog meat trade because he no longer wanted him. We rescued him with the help of local activists and brought him to NYC for a second chance at a better life. Gary is very friendly and loves affection. He has a gentle nature, but can become grumpy and possessive of toys, treats and food. Therefore Gary would do best with an adopter experienced in working with reactive dogs and continue working with our trainer after adoption for a few more months. Gary is 3-4 years old, neutered and has all his shots and vetting. Please consider adopting Gary and making him part of your family!

We believe people adopt rescue animals because even though there can be challenges, it is an extremely rewarding experience. As an adopter of a rescue animal, you are willing to accept the imperfections and baggage of an animalâs past and will work with them, train them, and love them for all that they are. Our adopted dogs who have gone to patient, loving families have had some incredible transformations, and we hope to provide each and every one of our rescues with this opportunity for a new life. We absolutely love seeing photos of our alums relaxed and smiling in their new adoptive homes, and we hope that you will consider adopting one of our pups and give them the opportunity to grow and find happiness with you.

653,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"12 Photos Â· Updated 3 years ago
Queens, NY - ****Update: 12/3/17**** Freddy is now staying at a vet hospital while we look for a foster home for him. Here is what his advocate and sponsor had to say about him : ""I managed to arrive a couple of minutes before Mathew brought Frodo in. He immediately made himself at home: jumping at everybody and kissing everybody. He is extremely outgoing, friendly and sweet dog. He came with scratched nose and sides of lips. I could lift him, hold him, put ointment on the scratches. He is very young and has a lot of energy of course. Thus I had to steady him by holding his muzzle to put ointment on â no problem at all. His accommodations are very good: the hospital is very warm, he has separate room with huge crate (good enough for a Great Dane), I provided two comforters, two soft wide collers, two leashes, a sweater and a coat. There are other animals in the hospital overnight too. I walked him longer than an hour yesterday night and today morning. We will continue this schedule of walking. I am taking it easy: he learned âwaitâ quickly so I can pick his poop up and let cars and people pass (not so many in this area). Making him walk together with me will be of course harder job. I do not request for dogs to truly heal but they should not ever be in front or in back of me â we should walk together side by side with them sniffing and etc. I will have pictures taken during the week-end: too much going on now. There is a possibility of foster round the corner from me. But I am taking everything one step at a time. The hospital personnel is very compassionate and experienced with rescue. They loved him from the first sight. They will take good care of him for now. I think he will get a lot of attention and will be much happier there. He is very small and I think he is a pedigree: a true pit with stance and body type â just miniature. I have seen some like that: the owners told me that they are called âBulli pitsâ. I will check it out."" Stay tuned for more on Freddy Frodo! A volunteer writes: Hello up there, new human friend! My nameâs Frodo, this is my chew toy, and weâre on the hunt for an adventureâ¦wanna come with me? Iâm a lot like that other Frodo you know, pint-sized, innocent and true of heart, I even have furry feet like him! My whole outlook on life is can-do and I donât have a beef with anyone. See how I meet passing people and dogs with tail wags and a wigglebutt? Thatâs just me being me, I am full of love! Iâm also full of energy and nothing makes me happier than getting my zoomie on in the yard, playing fetch or just running around with my peeps. I never guard my things, though I play a pretty good game of tug-o-war, and I always keep my mouth what they call âsoftâ so no one gets hurtânot even the toys! Cuddles are cool too and if you try to kiss me, guess what? Iâm gonna kiss you right back. So whaddya say? You, me, my chew toy and endless adventures full of snuggles and fun? I canât wait to have you as my new sidekick so please say yes. Pretty pretty please with dog treats on top?

654,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"***Brooklyn, NY*** 43 Lovebug 2 year old NEVILLE is looking for a Foster or Adopter to take her home! We don't have an AmsterDog newspaper but if we did, this beautiful girl Neville would be on the front page because we need to get her a home pronto. Neville, the Hawaiian Pineapple pizza of dogs, the indie rock band of pups, the Williamsburg of pooches, is differently delicious, enticingly edgy and crazy cool. Part pretty pittie, part little lovebug, Neville, has a neurological disorder that doesn't impact her lust for life one darn bit. It just looks like she's bopping to to the beat a little. We think it makes Neville that much more adorable and one in a million. It doesn't stop her from being one happy pup. And it doesn't stop her from dreaming of a home of her own. Or a pair of feet she can put her head on after a day of doing her favorite thing, running around in a big yard. Or giving kisses to her mama or daddy while she convinces them to give her treats. Or maybe even another dog brother or sister but we don't know about other dogs yet. What we do know, is this pup is just like all of us, looking for true love and for someone who sees it when they see her beautiful face. At the end of your day, no promotion, no new pair of shoes, not even really good pie is going to make you feel as good as the love of a pup. And Neville is a certified perfect pup. So call us! Email us! Message us! Neville can't use the computer so we will respond for her. Neville is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. Any vet expenses will be completely covered.

655,Young,Rat Terrier,"Hi, my name is Leon. I am a 1 year old, 10lb, Rat Terrier. I am house trained and crate trained. I am working on my leash training. I am good with dogs and cats and would prefer a home with older kids. I love dogs so much, I would like to be in a home with another dog as a companion. I am very sweet, playful and happy.

Want to adopt me? Fill out our online adoption application by visiting our website: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

Thank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42098531/1/?bust=1544592558 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42098531/2/?bust=1544592558 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42098531/3/?bust=1544592559 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42098531/4/?bust=1544592559,Leon,42098531,M,S,A

665,Adult,"Chihuahua, Pug","BOBBY is a 6 year old 6 pound Pug mixed with Chihuahua. He is a tiny pup with a huge personality. He is an adventurous walker that likes to lead the way but always looks back to make contact with his human. A true sign that he looks to his human as the leader.

Bobby enjoys sleeping next to his foster mom on a pillow by her head. While that might not be everyone's preference, sleeping in the bed is a must. So if you're not willing to share your bed with Bobby then he's not the right dog for you!

Bobby loves to cuddle and even be held. He is the ultimate lap dog! Bobby's great with other dogs and with cats too. Unfortunately Bobby was taunted by the children in his first home which is in part why he was given up. So please no children, current or future. 

Bobby is super food motivated and therefore easy to train, which is good because he'll need someone willing to help with housebreaking. 

Bobby is up-to-date on shots, neutered and microchipped. Application, home visit, contract and adoption fee required.

I'm shy at first but once I warm up I'm all kisses and wiggles. I'm still a pup so  I'm energetic and I need daily structured exercise and discipline. I know basic commands & housebroken,  but I need further leash training.  I currently live with several dogs but I got into a competition with one of the males so my foster mom feels I would be best with a female dog. Unfortunately I've not been around young kids and never met a cat so I'm not sure how I would be with them. I would love to be with a person/couple/family that knows, understands and appreciates my breed and will be active in giving me the exercise and training that I need to make me a more secure balanced dog. I'm a gorgeous loving young boy and I will be your loyal BFF!! Pls come meet/adopt me today!

Luckily for China a Good Samaritan was able to watch over her and advocate for her so that she made it out of the kill shelter alive. China at first appeared to be terrified and confused by her sudden stroke of bad luck, one can imagine that being left for dead on the side of the road can be devastating to anyone. China is currently in our boarding facility where she had the chance to chill out and just relax after the whole terrible ordeal of being abandoned then hitting the euth list where she wouldâve likely died if we didnât step in. What we learned from China over the past few months is that she is pretty pawesome! China loves to take long drives, sheâs fantastic in the car. China is also a world class ball player. We noticed China hates the crate, so no biggie she doesnât have to go in one if it makes her uncomfortable. China definitely came out of her shell and shown us her potential. We are seeking an experienced foster for China, a home with no other dogs or cats.  If you would like to foster China please email rhdrdoggies@gmail.com to find out more about her.

We saw her with her entire family (including a toddler) as she was being surrendered to the shelter due to a family tragedy.  Although she was very calm and relaxed with her family, we found that once away from them she has some quirks.....   Primary as her intense dislike of crate confinement.  Her original owners described her as low key, low energy.
We are finding that she is a bit out of shape and could use more exercise....
We also found that she is wary of some strangers.  
She is going to work with a trainer.

685,Young,American Staffordshire Terrier,"New Hampshire: Maui is an energetic and loving dog.  She will do best with an active family that can drain her energy.  Maui absolutely loves things like hiking in the woods in the summer, where there are lots of interesting things to smell and check out.  She would do best in a family without very young children as she sometimes is not aware of her strength and younger children could be accidentally hurt/knocked over.  She is not mouthy, but can occasionally put your wrist in her mouth when greeting you - however she doesn't bite or chew it at all, she is very gentle. Maui is quick to learn, is very treat-driven.  However, she requires a lot of consistency and repeated rewards - she can be stubborn and take her time having behaviors become learned (completed quickly without repeated asking). Maui knows signs for sit, down, stay, off.  She will sit and wait to be released to eat dinner, once you put her bowl on the floor.  Maui knows how to use a treadmill, and although requires being leashed to it so she doesn't look around and wander off it, it is a great resource for draining energy on days with very bad/inclement weather. Maui has a very high prey drive - if she sees a rabbit or squirrel run in a particular direction, she will try to go that way for several days; she also likes to chase cars. A fenced-in yard would be ideal to prevent her from racing off after small critters, if you don't want to have her tethered/leashed in some manner.  She does not like her ears touched much - sometimes soft rubs are ok but mostly she turns away from having her ears touched. Maui is extremely loving and just loves being with people.  She does seem to take a while to settle in and get comfortable but once that happens some of her constant high energy level starts to go down a bit. A slower introduction to other dogs is recommended.

686,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Long Island: Diesel yearns for the love and touch of humans so much that he hurt himself trying to dig his way out of his dog run while in boarding to get to the caretakers of the facility. Diesel would dig and dig and dig whenever he heard the voices of humans, he desperately wants to be with people and is so tired of being alone so much that he is hurting himself in the process. One of our volunteers was able to take him into foster for the past month and brought him to the vet to assess the situation and we found out that Diesel managed to fracture his own ankles because of his frustration. Sadly his foster is ending because our volunteer will be leaving the country and Diesel still requires follow up medical care, he canât go back to boarding in this condition. He currently is being treated for a bone infection caused by self inflicted wounds caused by his digging. His foster mom reports that Diesel is incredibly loving and just wants to be cared for to feel secure. Diesel does have limited vision but he compensates by using his other senses. Diesel is great at nose work and can find treats and toys without any help. Diesel also loves to play fetch! Diesel has shown some separation anxiety in his foster home but once he feels secure and knows he wonât be left alone it eases up a bit. Diesel really needs a kind soul to take him home so he has the opportunity to heal and build his self confidence. Diesel is 2 years old and spent the majority of his life in boarding; he likely feels all alone in this world and he wants nothing more than to be loved. We desperately need a foster or adopter to step up for him. We will pay for food, medical, and whatever else he needs if you can provide him with love. It would be best for him to be the only dog in the home due to his medical needs at this time. If Diesel returns to boarding he will likely just hurt himself again and that would be tragic. Diesel is a very special dog who lost his vision due to juvenile cataracts, his blindness doesnât get in his way he just really needs a person who is willing to work with him to get comfortable with his new surroundings, we recommend no small children even though he adores them. Heâs a real lover boy, so open your heart to him.  If you are interested in fostering or adopting Diesel, please email us at rhdrdoggies@gmail.com,",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32754724/1/?bust=1437083412 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32754724/2/?bust=1503972190 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32754724/3/?bust=1503972191 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32754724/4/?bust=1497833218 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32754724/5/?bust=1503972191,DIESEL,32754724,M,M,A

Jack gets along great with all dogs no matter the size, he will share his stuff and is very affectionate. Jack loves to play with his toys and has proven a quick learner with hand signals. Like most deaf dogs Jack is in tune with his human and will keep his eyes on you for directions. Jack is quiet in the home and very respectful, his potty training skills are coming along very nicely. Jack is very gentle and will flop on his back for a good belly rub. Jack loves to go on walks and loves to play so he will make a great pal for any home. We are unsure how Jack is with cats because on walks he tried to chase them, but then again he tried to chase a leaf too so that will have to be determined in the future.

688,Adult,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Pit Bull Terrier","Long Island: Snoopy is a 4 year old, 50 lb sweet cow print guy who has been in boarding ever since we pulled him from death row. We had pulled him for an adopter who bailed on him and he hasnât gotten one application since. Snoopy is not doing well in boarding, he is nervous and very sad. Snoopy likes his caretakers and is friendly with them but he really wants a family to call his own. What we know about him is that Snoopy has lived with his former owner since he was a few weeks old, he has lived with a 2 year old child but has been around kids of all ages. He is playful, respectful, and tolerant of the kids. He plays in an exuberant manner with adults and plays in a gentle manner with kids. He has never lived with any kind of animal and ignores dogs when walked. He has never bitten a person or animal. Snoopy has no behavior issues and will hide during storms. Snoopy is not bothered if food or a treat of any kind is touched while he is eating. He is not bothered if a toy is taken away, if pushed off furniture, if held, if disturbed while sleeping, if brushed, during nail trimming, or if someone unfamiliar approaches owner or family member. He enjoys bath time. He will bark if someone knocks on the door. Snoopy is friendly, playful, affectionate, and confident with a medium to high activity level. Snoopy likes to play with rope style toys. He likes to play tug and fetch. He is kept indoors only and sleeps in his own bed. If left home alone Snoopy is well behaved. Snoopy will sleep in the crate if the door is left open. He knows commands like sit, stay, and give me five. On leash Snoopy does not pull and off leash he wanders but comes back when called. If you think you are the perfect match for the much overlooked Snoopy please  email rhdrdoggies@gmail.com to find out more information.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36421861/1/?bust=1475864515 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36421861/2/?bust=1475864516 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36421861/3/?bust=1475864516,Snoopy   LOVES  PIZZA!!,36421861,M,L,A
689,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Molly is a 5 year old, 70 lb mush that loves to cuddle. Molly is friendly with people and  would be an ideal pet for a family with kids! She knows commands such as sit, give paw, and lay down.  Molly will behave when alone but much prefers the company of others. Molly loves to play--her toy of choice is a tennis ball, but don't expect it to last the whole day! Molly loves to run, and take long walks.  Molly is good on a leash and she is extremely housebroken, she even lets you know when she has to go out, but she does not like the rain! Water is her nemesis!!  She is on a grain free diet and LOVES to chew on bully sticks and other chews. Molly has never gone to the bathroom or destroyed any household items except fleece blankets and thatâs because she thinks they're toys!  Molly is protective of her caretakers and will bark at passers by or other dogs, but she's happy to see company when they come visit and are welcomed inside by her caretakers.  She loves belly rubs, tug of war, and couch cuddle time, and Molly is super smart.  She recognizes words like, walk, out, treat, and toy. We say things like, ""Molly, do you want to go for a walk?"" Or, ""Do you want to go out?"" And she runs to where we keep her leash.  If we say, ""Molly, do you want a treat?"" She gets excited and runs to where we keep her treats. If we say, ""Molly, go get your toy!"" She runs to her bed and pulls out a toy to play with. I'm sure with further training, you can get Molly to do lots of other things, sheâs a good student a quick learner, you just need to be persistent!  Molly is not a fan of cats at all, she has engaged with a male dog of her size and was harmonious, however she does not really like female friends. Molly is a major sweetheart and is looking to come home with you today!

Blanco has an irresistibly quirky personality and a lust for life that just wonât quit, he is affectionate and super social, he likes meeting new friends and leaps onto laps to exchange kisses for snuggles as soon as heâs invited up. Like many hearing impaired pups, Blanco uses his sensitive nose and keen eyes to explore the big wide world and heâs always on the lookout for new and exciting things to spot, snuffle and taste. He walks well on leash, seems house trained and greets other dogs politely but of course he should be introduced to any new four-legged friends slowly.

Brownie is about 6 years old and 55 lbs with a gorgeous shaggy coat. He is really sweet, shy and mellow, and deserves a quiet home outside the city with a soft bed and a mom or dad to cuddle him for the holidays. 

He is great with other dogs, and we are looking for a home with another dog to keep him company because he seems sad and lonely alone. He is fine with kids but older is better because energetic little ones would probably be overwhelming for him.

I was rescued by our wonderful rescue partner from the streets of Puerto Rico where I was abandoned and left to fend for myself.  I was so excited and relieved to be rescued.  I knew things were about to get alot better for me :)).  The President of our rescue met Tito at our rescue partner's home when she was in Puerto Rico and committed to finding Tito a forever home as soon as we had a foster available.  My rescuer loved and cared for me until I was ready to take my liberation flight.  I have now arrived in New York :)).

My foster family in New York City says I am a SUPER sweet dog :).  I am a good combination of playful yet calm.  I LOVE other dogs and cuddling on the couch to give and receive lots of love and affection :)).  I also walk well on a leash.  I would really enjoy a forever home with another dog and a fenced in yard.

Truly Terrific Tito is 7 years old, 51 lbs., neutered, fully vetted and vaccinated

I was rescued from the streets of Puerto Rico by the President of our rescue and her 15 year old daughter where I was abandoned and left to fend for myself.  I was so excited and relieved to be rescued.  I knew things were about to get alot better for me :)).  My rescuer loved and cared for me until I was ready to take my liberation flight.

My foster family in Brooklyn, NY says I am a SUPER sweet dog :)  I am shy at first but very loving once I am comfortable.  I am a perfect combination of playful yet calm.  I enjoy playing with dogs and then I like cuddling on the couch to give and receive lots of love and affection :)).

830,Adult,"Pit Bull Terrier, Hound","Woof! Hello! I'm Santana, and I am an 11 year old hound mix who weighs around 55 lbs. I guarantee I'm the happiest dog you'll ever meet! I am ALWAYS happy and ALWAYS wagging my tail. I love ear scratches, butt scratches, and belly rubs! :-)

I don't yet know any commands, but I am working hard on sit and focus. I get lots of treats when I practice ... what more could I ask for? Ha! I walk well on my leash, especially in a harness, and am great passing dogs of all sizes, runners, and cyclists. I recently went on a pack walk with several other doggies and I was a superstar!

I easily share my food, toys, and special treats. Yup, I said toys. I am a true puppy at heart when it comes to playing with toys. Throw a ball or play tug with a rope ... I'm in! I easily drop my toys whenever asked. I'm such a good boy!

As I mentioned above, I am a happy fella with an absolute heart of gold. I will literally roll over on your feet for cuddles. I'm told I can melt hearts with my adorable antics and puppy dog eyes!

I'd do great in a home with even young children (say, around age 6 and up) and, of course, adults. I'd also be a wonderful addition to a home with another doggie. I am respectful, playful, and submissive with other dogs. I get all wiggly when I encounter a new doggie friend, but I remain polite. Please bring your dog along with you when you come to visit me.

Thanks for reading all about me. If you're looking for an older doggie who is still playful and is absolutely bursting with joy, I'm your guy. I can't wait to meet you!

Love, Santana xoxo

I was recently surrendered to the shelter when my owner could no longer properly care for me. I have done a great job of acclimating to shelter life. I can be a tiny bit shy at first, but I really enjoy meeting new people and experiencing new things. My human friends say I melt their hearts. Aww!

I easily share my food and special treats when asked like the good boy I am. I also will drop my beloved ball -- I *love* playing ball! -- for a yummy treat. I have polite manners, so I don't jump up or act silly or anything. I listen really well and walk nicely on my leash, only occasionally tugging. I'm a great doggie!

Guess what else? I love belly rubs! If you want to be my new best friend, just give me a few belly rubs. It's the key to my heart! Hehe!

Thanks for reading all about me! If you're looking for a kind-hearted pooch with a gentle disposition, I'm the fella for you. I hope to meet you soon!

833,Adult,"Pit Bull Terrier, Hound","Woof! Hello! My name is Toby, and I am a six year old hound / pittie mix who weighs just over 75 lbs (I'm a husky boy!). I am friendly, affectionate, silly, and an all-around good boy ... if I do say so myself! :-)

I was recently brought to the shelter after spending over five years in a home. I've adjusted well to my new circumstances and sit quietly in my cage. Don't let that fool you, though ... I am a playful, active, fun-loving boy!

I love to be out and about and walk great on my leash in a harness. I easily pass doggies, runners, and other distractions. I sometimes grab my leash, but I correct easily. I also do a great ""sit"" on command and have a gentle mouth for taking treats.

I love, love, LOVE to play with toys -- ropes, balls, squeakies -- and will happily chase down anything you'd like to throw my way. I can get easily overstimulated, but, again, I respond well to corrections. I'll easily trade my toy for a yummy treat. I'm a good boy!

When I'm excited, I can jump up or get a little nibbly. I don't mean anything bad by this ... I just never got over this silly puppy behavior. For this reason, I would do best in a home with older kids and, of course, adults.

Do you have a doggie at home? I am great with other dogs! I am both playful and submissive with other pups, and I'd absolutely thrive in a multi-dog household. I recently went to a big adoption event and did great being surrounded by other pups. Please bring your doggie along with you when you come to visit me.

One of my human friends said these nice words about me:

""Toby is the best! Through no fault of his own, he's back at the shelter, and he's the same sweetheart he's always been. Toby is absolutely adorable -- no dog has a cuter snaggletooth! -- and he's super social and absolutely loves being around people. He acts like a puppy sometimes, but he's very innocent. He's a fun dog!""

Thank you. And thank you for reading all about me. If you're looking for a playful boy with the best smile around, I'm the dog for you. I can't wait to meet you.!

Love, Toby xoxo

PS ~ I'm also good with cats!

This little poodle is approximately 8 years old.Â  Please read his story:

Buddy was found tied to a tree in Juniper Park, Middle Village, and taken in by our group.Â  This is one of the worst cases of neglect and abuse we have ever seen.

Buddy couldn't be touched due to the severity of the matting of his coat. At first, his sex couldn't even be determined. The pain and suffering this poor little dog has had to endure is simply unimaginable.Â  He was rushed to the vet where he had to be anesthetized, shaved down, and bathed.Â  He received extensive blood work and a dental procedure during which multiple teeth were removed.

With the love and patience being shown to him by our staff and volunteers,Â  Buddy has begun to feel like a dog again. This innocent little dog hasn't had an easy life but has found a SAFE haven with us.Â  Buddy will need a very kind and patient adopter who is willing to work with him to continue building up his confidence and trust.Â  He really needs a good friend and forever home...

Buddy likes other dogs.Â  You can meet this awesome little boy at our Atlas location, 80-36 Cooper Ave., Glendale.

This little guy has been through a lot ... in the shelter, needing hernia surgery, our rescue got him out, got him what he needs and he's doing GREAT in his foster home! His personality or spirit hasn't been dampened one bit, and he's ready for his forever ...

Toby loves his walks and hikes. He loves the resident dog in the home. He loves his foster mom and dad and is loving and affectionate. He has the adorable habit of doing ""zoomies"" after his shower, and he ""spins"" in circles when he's happy! Toby's ideal home would be adult only.

Toby is mature at nine years old, but has lots of life left in him! He is utd on his shots and neutered. He is house trained and crate trained.  

Toby so deserves a loving, caring, committed home after all he's been through ... we promised him that!

After being in a large, crowded shelter for a very long time, he was transferred to another facility because his time was up and everyone wanted him to have another chance. 
    
Sadly without the staff and volunteers that he knew so well and feeling alone and isolated, he became depressed and shut down. He was not going to make it out :( Until we rescued him because we knew his beautiful spirit would shine once he knew he was not abandoned by his friends. And that is exactly what happened! 

He is getting a little older but still has that puppy enthusiasm for life. All he wants is someone to tell him he's a good boy and to come home to him at night,  and he will  let you know that he is overflowing with joy to see you home :)   He loves to explore the outdoors with his person and is up for any activity that is planned for him. He is good natured when meeting new friends, understanding of active little dogs that want to play with him and think they are as big as he is, and is learning beautiful manners so that he is a wonderful ambassador for his breed. He will make his family proud and will be your  most devoted companion.

I was rescued from a junkyard where I was kept with my parents and my siblings.  I'm very submissive and have been good with everyone I've met so far - dogs, cats & unfortunately I have an aversion to young kids so no young kids for me. I have no handling issues but need further obedience and leash training but I'm quick to learn and eager to please. I'm a quiet sweet shy flower and very mild mannered. I don't like to be left alone so much and I will get into things so I really really would love to go with another dog/cat to keep me company.  I need someone who knows and understands my breed and will take the time to work with me and make me a more confident gal. I would love to be with another dog to give me support. I am a JEWEL of a DOG!!  Pls come meet me today!

I was rescued in the nick of time from a kill shelter. I'm a sweet, silly, happy go lucky little linebacker of a munchkin ""bully"".  I'm still young and will need further obedience training;  but I'm eager to please and quick to learn. I am very strong but walk pretty well on a leash and am medium energy. I'm good with dogs in passing but selective with some dogs mostly small dogs  as I have a bit of ""prey drive"" so I would be best as a SOLO DOG so I can get ALL the attention!. Since I'm a bit of a tank and strong, it's best if I go with older kids ages 10 yrs + as I could knock down a toddler.  I'm a little too curious about cats so unfortunately NO CATS for me. I'm the cutest thing and am perfectly apt sized but ideally a fenced in yard for me to run around and get my YA YA's out would be BEST. Im' looking for someone/couple that has had PREVIOUS BULLY BREED EXPERIENCE and KNOWS & APPRECIATES my breed.  I will make a wonderful loyal companion! Come meet my bobble head today!!

899,Young,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Pit Bull Terrier","My name is DUCKY and I'm a handsome 11 mo M White/Black Amstaff/Pitbull X. I'm 55 lbs of SILLY HAPPY GO LUCKY BOY.  I am affectionately named so because I have bent front legs and slightly bowed back legs and the vet says it could be due to being crated as a young puppy for months in a crate that was too small or it could be a genetic condition and I was not given proper nutrition so my bones didn't form properly. Either/or the vet feels that surgery would be too painful and risky at this point. It's ok, my bent legs give me character and a sweet goofy ""Charlie Chaplin"" walk and I get along just fine. I love to run and play and when I run you can barely notice my bent legs. I'm super fun loving and sweet and friendly to all. I am good with other dogs but I am a little ackward in approach so I tend to scare small dogs a bit but I'm good with other playful young big dogs. I'm a little too interested in cats and will chase them. I think I would be best with older kids ages 10 yrs + and because of my legs it would be best for me to be in a home in the country with a grass yard so I can be on soft surfaces because of my legs. I am a very ""SPECIAL"" boy in more ways than one and I will unleash my charm on you once you meet me.. so please come meet me today!

Loves to be cuddled and loved! And don't all dogs deserve that? Another dog with him would be best as he can learn to follow him around till hes used to everything.

911! 911! PLEASE HELP US SAVE DONNIEâS LIFE!!! URGENT FOSTER HOME NEEDED!

We are desperately trying to save this nine year old male Cocker Spanielâs life! Donnie was brought to the Brooklyn Shelter as a stray, he was petrified and upon his medical intake exam, he bit a tech. He was put on a 10 day hold and now his hold is up. Because of the bite, regardless if he was frightened, he is not available for public adoption. Donnie is really a sweet boy and deserves a chance. Please HELP us SAVE HIS LIFE! We are in URGENT need of a place TODAY for Donnie to hang his leash and get some much need TLC. Please complete our online application at 
http://www.nyabandonedangels.com/adopt-or-foster-application. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!

SHELTER NOTES:

3/28/18: Don remains easy to handle during our sessions. He is easy to rope and bring out to the pens. He is soft and social during the interactions. He takes treats gently and shows a brief interest in tennis balls. He did balk at the rope but otherwise easily roped and returned to his kennel. -MC

3/26/18: Don was sitting at the front of his kennel when I approached. He stood up while I was unlocking the kennel door. Don was easily roped and lead into the SAFER room. Once in the room Don was easily leashed and unroped. Once off the rope Don immediately began exploring the room. Intermittently Don would approach me or my coworker and solicit attention by jumping onto our legs or giving kisses. Towards the end of the session Don was spending more and more time sitting or laying next to me and allowing me to pet his head and back. Don did not whine or shake the entire session. His body was loose and his mouth was mostly closed with a long lip. At the end of his session Don was easily unleashed, roped, and returned to his kennel. -JN

3/25/18: There is no significant changes with Don. In fact our session today was almost identical to yesterday's. He was less anxious and did not whine, but he did begin trembling at the very end of the session. I am conflicted if it was out of nervousness or if he was cold. I was petting him to the point where he was very relaxed and closing his eyes right before he began trembling, so I think it was most likely that he was just cold. This was also the only time he solicited attention from me during the session. Otherwise, he kept to himself and had a loose body and relaxed ears. He did at one point have his tail tucked, but very lightly. He also remained easy to re-rope, remove the drag, and return to his kennel.-MB

3/24/18: Don was sitting at the front of his kennel as I approached. He remains easy to rope, remove, and bring outside. He also gives no difficulty with attaching a drag leash. Once in the pens, as usual, he went straight to the last pen. He briefly sniffed around and then relived himself. He stayed in the 4th pen for the whole session, except to briefly step over the threshold. In the beginning he had a loose body and open mouth. After he relieved himself he began pacing in the pen, looking out towards the street. At this time a fellow employee was leaving the parking lot to walk a new arrival. Don went to the corner of the pen closest to where the other dog was. He then began whining and anxiously barking. Even after the other dog was out of view he sat down and stared at the street. I then noticed that he had begun trembling. I sat down next to him and began to pet him softly. He continued to tremble and would only stop briefly when startled by any noise. After a few minutes, he remained in the same position and continued trembling. I decided to end the session and began grabbing my rope, etc. At this point he walked over to me and I bent down and started petting him. He stood there and allowed me to pet him, while he closed his eyes and leaned into me. Since he seemed to enjoy it I continued for a bit. Then he got distracted and began going back to the corner of the 4th pen. I ended the session, and removed the drag, roped him, and brought him back with no problem.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41320082/1/?bust=1522790253,Donnie,41320082,M,M,A

URGENT FOSTER HOME & DONATIONS NEEDED FOR BUCKLEY!

AACSR is pleading for a special long term foster with the biggest of hearts to help our newest NEGLECTED ANGEL, seven-year- old Buckley. When we were contacted to help rehome this poor, sad soul, we of course said yes. The picture the owner presented was far rosier than the reality of Buckley's neglect  and suffering. Buckley's medical issues begin with untreated hypothyroidism, which has left him obese at 46 pounds, such that he is crippled and barely able to walk. Recent x-rays show bilateral ACL tears. He will need to have two orthopedic surgeries  ASAP to repair both hind legs (12 weeks apart). We will never know how long he has suffered in pain with these tears, however degenerative joint disease (DJD)  is already present. The longer he waits, the more quickly the disease will progress and the greater its impact on his mobility will be. His skin reeks of secondary bacterial and yeast infections (also from the hypothyroidism), and is black and thickened like an elephantâs skin across large areas, complete with patches of missing fur. When we rescued Buckley, his nails were also curled like corkscrews into his pads, clearly not clipped since his puppyhood. Emotionally,  this suffering soulâs light has completely gone out. He is despondent, flat, and withdrawn. Somewhere inside, we know that Buckley is still there and can with time come back to us. With love, encouragement, and medical care, we believe he can still become the beautiful boy he was always meant to be. If you can take Buckley into your home for a lengthy period of foster care, please contact us ASAP at rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or complete and return an online application at www.nyabandonedangels.com. As Buckley will shortly be having ACL surgery, he will require a home with no stairs and a fenced in yard.  If you cannot foster but would like to help with a donation towards his medical costs, we would be very grateful. We are not financially prepared for the medical nightmare of Buckleyâs rehabilitation. Please help us to help him!!

BIG NEWS! I am ready for ADOPTION!! I have (largely) overcome my fears around feet and am ready to find true love!! I would do great with a single woman or a low key couple who are savvy with rescued dogs. My name (Leo) reflects my big heart, which is about the size of a lipnâs. I love, love, love my people, but sometimes I just need a minute or to have a little space. I am an 8 year old Lhasa/Poodle cross, low shed, fully housebroken, and mellow in the house. I enjoy short walks but nothing too strenuous, as I have a touch of arthritis (a daily dose of glucosamine helps me to feel fit). I am otherwise a healthy boy who is neutered, vaccinated and heartworm negative. Can you give me a home? I have been a perfect boy in foster care and have even enjoyed a road trip (that was fun, I liked the hotel, and being on vacation). Please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com, where you can complete and return an application online. I am waiting to hear from you and am ready to come home!!



UH-OH! Leo is a return to rescue, which of course is a very sad outcome. He was originally placed with a Cocker family, who had no experience with his breed. Our mistake, we are sorry, Leo, you needed a Lhasa family! Leo is a 8 year old Lhasa/Poodle cross who has a Lhasa temperament. Despite a very cute appearance, the Lhasa has  a tough-minded character. Leo of course enjoys a good cuddle (massage of his ears and neck are his favorite), but is definitely not a play thing. When heâs had enough, he wants his space, and his family will need to respect that. Although nimble and also very agile, we believe Leo to have been injured, most likely kicked in his early life, which has slightly affected his gait. He can be cautious and fearful of feet, especially as he has a low stature. We are looking for a Lhasa lover with breed experience to become Leoâs permanent person. While he is currently fostering with a mom and a dad, he clearly does prefer women. We are thinking that a single woman might be best for him (she will soon become his whole world). Please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com to submit an application. Leo has been neutered, microchipped, is current on all shots, and is also heartworm negative. This loving Lhasa is ready to go but he needs a destination.

PRAISE FOR OUR FRIENDS AT FLORIDA COASTAL COCKER RESCUE ... SOMETIMES IT TAKES A RESCUE VILLAGE JUST TO SAVE ONE DOG!

?? MILO ??

Recently we learned of a 4 year old Cocker/German Shepherd cross who was losing his home due to divorce and foreclosure in the southern part of Florida. With everyone in the family having too many problems, Milo was headed for the shelter, which is exactly where this family got him just a few short years ago. Poor Milo!! His only advocate was the familyâs daughter, who had looked after Milo before going to college, and was trying to find him a home. When she could not succeed, she began to try rescues, which is how we heard about Milo. No matter how bleak the picture seemed for him, with the city pound looking inevitable, she simply would not give up on Milo, as she really loved her dog. Although Milo is in Florida, we agreed that we would take him, then Florida Coastal Cocker Rescue agreed to hold him until transport is arranged. We are very grateful to FCCR for offering this much needed help. We are looking now for a foster home once Milo arrives in New York. This big chubby boy is great with people and can be placed with kids. As Milo has been under exercised, he needs an active foster, who ideally will be willing to walk with him, so that he can shed some weight. Milo is currently 76 pounds, but should be a maximum of 60. He therefore needs to be on a strict diet alongside his exercise routine. Milo is good with other dogs as long as they are low key. He has been neutered, microchipped, is current on all shots, and has tested heartworm negative. To be sure that there are no unaddressed issues, we will be running full blood work on Milo, and will also be giving him a dental cleaning just as soon as he arrives. Anyone out there have a BIG GIANT HEART for this GIANT COCKER MIX? The familyâs daughter loved him enough to fight for him to get rescue. We now hope that someone will love him enough to offer him a home. If you can help, please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com, where you can complete an online application. Here comes our Florida Big Guy, MILO, heading for the Big Apple!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42476495/1/?bust=1534301500,Milo,42476495,M,L,A

PEBBLES TRAGIC DEATH  10/14/18:

We are devastated and grieving over the tragic death of our dog Pebbles, who had been placed in boarding at  Northwind Kennels, in Bedford, NY.  

Pebbles, a senior Cocker, had been boarding along with her senior Pit Bull sister CInnabon since mid-summer while we tried to find this deeply bonded pair a home together. On Saturday, October 13th, Pebbles was viciously attacked and mortally wounded by another Pit Bull by the name of Wanda (owned by a private client of Northwind Kennels). We are unclear how this horrendous tragedy happened. Initially, we were told by the facilityâs owner that Wanda climbed over a 6 foot chain link fence dividing two adjoining play areas. The next day, she told us that Wanda had managed to shimmy her way under a defective fence. As the dogs had been left unattended, there are no witnesses to Pebblesâ attack. We were told by the owner she has working cameras throughout her facility, but has refused to provide us with video of the incident.

We were told by the volunteer worker who left the dogs unattended that she returned to the play area to witness Cinnabon fighting with Wanda some ten feet away from the spot where Pebbles was lying bleeding and severely injured. We believe Cinnabon was attempting to ward Wanda off and to save her beloved Cocker sister, but to no avail. Northwind staff brought Pebbles to an emergency clinic but failed to notify us of the attack for almost 5 hours, which we consider inexcusable. Pebbles had undergone  emergency surgery in the early hours of the morning on 10/14, but her condition continued to worsen. In the hopes of saving her life, we transferred her by ambulance to the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan later that day, where she died shortly after arrival. The AMC informs us that she suffered a spinal injury in the attack and that she had also developed sepsis. In our rescueâs 15 year history, this incident is one of the most devastating things to happen to one of our dogs. 

We ask you to pray for Cinnabon, who witnessed the attack on her best friend, and now is deeply grieving in her temporary foster home.  RIP our poor sweet Pebbles. You did not deserve this fate.  Forever in Cinnabonâs and our hearts... ???


GETTING OLD CAN BE THE PITS! BONDED SENIORS DUMPED IN SHELTER, URGENT HELP IS NEEDED!

Dogs are INDIVIDUALS, they should not be placed in pigeon holes just because of their breed. We have recently learned about two seniors dumped in the Manhattan Shelter, a female Cocker and her lifetime companion, who happens to be a Pit. Pebbles is the Cocker, Cinnabon is the Pit Bull, both are wonderful dogs. Both girls will shortly be coming our way, so we are in urgent need of a foster home where they can be placed together. Both scored high on their temperament tests when evaluated at the shelter, so there is no need to be frightened of Cinnabon just because of her breed. These girls cannot be separated, as they are a bonded pair. Pebbles and Cinnabon will fully vetted prior to being placed (to include full bloodwork, spay, dental, they will get the works). Both have been fully vaccinated at the shelter and are also heartworm negative. Senior medical is always costly, so donations are urgently needed. Donations can be made via our website at www.nyabandonedangels.com/donate. 

Please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com if you are able to foster or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com to submit an application. Life should not end up being the pits just because oneâs a senior, nor should two dogs be pulled apart just because of breed.

HELP!!!!

Maxi needs your help! This poor 12-year-old male senior was surrendered to the Brooklyn Shelter because his family could not afford his medical care. He has immature cataracts, a severe odorous ear infection (stenotic ears), severe dental disease, and an anal mass. All of these issues did not crop up overnight, the neglect of this dog has gone on for YEARS. Maxi is sugar sweet and has lived with a two-year-old child. He is extremely loving and playful despite his very sad circumstances. Maxi does not deserve to die because he is sick and neglected. He devoted his life to those he called family and is now alone and facing death. We can start a campaign to raise funds for his care, but need an immediate foster home, as he has no place to go. Maxi deserves the Max not the Minimum, which is all he has known in life.

EMERGENCY EMERGENCY EMERGENCY!! 

This is an All-Hands-On-Deck plea for JAKE! 

This past July, we were asked to help Little Jake, a beautiful 4 year old buff Cocker boy at the shelter. Without hesitation, we stepped up and said YES!. Sadly, Little Jake's  chronic ear infections were  never properly addressed by his previous âfamilyâ, resulting in painful, stenotic, infected ear canals. Jake now needs his RESCUE FAMILY to save him from ongoing pain. We have been doing all we can to save his ears, which have been packed several times with antibiotics while sedated. Sadly, all of our efforts have merely served as a small band-aid on a huge wound. Little Jake is suffering daily with mind-splitting ear pain. He has been medicated with his life on hold while we work to raise $5000, the cost of bilateral ear ablation surgery.  Emergency surgery on the first ear is scheduled for THIS THURSDAY. We must raise $2,500 within the next two days. It is cruel to keep him in this condition, he CANNOT WAIT any longer. We have taken a huge leap of faith that we will raise the funds in time. JAKE HAS NO ONE BUT HIS RESCUE FAMILY TO TURN TO AT THIS TIME. Please donate as generously as you can to Little Jake's fund via the following link:   
https://www.paypal.me/abandonedangels      

Little Jake needs us all very badly, please donât let him down. Our heartfelt thanks.

JACK needs a local adult only loving foster home while we raise funds for his ear ablation surgery. He is super sweet and will only get sweeter once he has surgery and is pain free.

URGENT FOSTER HOME NEEDED FOR JERSEY GIRL! 

Recently we were contacted by a Good Samaritan who pulled an emaciated 16 pound young female Cocker out of the Atlantic City Pound. We are calling this sweet baby Jersey Girl. She had very pale gums at the time of intake, which we thought must be due to hunger, but blood work has shown she has IMHA (immune hemolytic anemia). This is a potentially deadly condition in which the body attacks its own red blood cells. With steroid treatment, she has started to rally, but still may need a blood transfusion (we will know when we run the next blood work). We will know more when she arrives at our vetâs office during the course of tomorrow. We have treated dogs with IMHA before, so the disease is actually well known to us. If the dog responds well to early treatment, the long term prognosis is good. We are in need of an immediate foster home (ideally within 1 hour of Flushing, NY) where Jersey Girl can rest and get care. She is proving to be good with other calm dogs and is also friendly with people. If you are able to foster our sweet Jersey Girl, please email rescue@nyabandonedangels.com or visit www.nyabandonedangels.com, where you can complete and return an application online. Summer beach days may be over now, but Jersey still has a future ahead. Please help us to help her continue her life. Her medical condition can likely be managed and she is far too young to die.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42891341/1/?bust=1538323835,Jersey Girl,42891341,F,M,A

Our Tibbie Mom (âMommaâ aka âPuffyâ) has a problem. Her pups are now 10 weeks old (the normal age for separation of mom and babies) but she continues to be very possessive of them, shaking and crying with great distress whenever they are taken from her. We have never had this experience with any new mother. Usually by this point our moms have been ready to part ways with their babies and go on with their own lives. NOT MOMMA. We know this to be her fifth (and last) litter of Tibbie babies and can only assume that her prior litters were torn away from her too early or otherwise very traumatically. We have determined that the only way forward for Momma is to be placed with at least one of her pups so that they can move on into the future together. WE ARE DESPERATELY SEEKING AN ADOPTIVE HOME FOR 7 YEAR OLD MOMMA WITH ONE MALE PUPPY. It will be safe to spay Momma in 2 weeksâ time (at which point she will also have surgery to correct her double cherry eye). We want Momma to be the first to leave rescue (with one of her pups), as it will be too distressing for her to see the first two leave. She is chronically looking for her puppies in her current environment. We believe it will be the least traumatic for her to leave rescue FIRST in the company of one baby so that they can have a fresh start as a bonded pair.

URGENT FOSTER HOME NEEDED FOR PEARL BAILEY! 

OK, FB followers, hope your sitting down for this one! It may top our list of MOST HEARTLESS OWNER DUMPS!
We were contacted this afternoon by the NYACC to HELP another throwaway senior Cocker Spaniel.

Pearl Bailey is a 10 year old, obese female Cocker who probably was never treated like the precious jewel she was named after. Are you ready?? Poor Pearl was found tied at JFK airport at the departures of a busy terminal. Reports state Pearl was denied boarding on the plane as an emotional support dog. Instead of standing by their devoted Cocker, Pearl was left behind and tied to a post. Obviously a mere inconvenience or afterthought as her devoted owner flew off for perhaps a lavish vacation, or an adventure abroad. 

We can only imagine the fear Pearl experienced, abandoned in amidst the chaos of one of the busiest airports. Pearl was kept at the shelter for 8 days while her owner was finally located in London. Without hesitation, Pearl was no longer wanted. Pearl has a plethora of ailments, an URI with yellow nasal discharge which could likely progress to pneumonia $$$ severe dental disease $$$ infected ears $$$ and one more, cataracts.$$$ 
We do not know the extent of what is ahead for us and Pearl, but we are asking you to come along for the ride, one more time. We cannot take on another medical case without your support. Please help us provide poor Pearl with the medical care she needs. Our heartfelt thanks!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43451135/1/?bust=1543932606,Pearl Bailey,43451135,F,M,A

URGENT FOSTER NEEDED ... BONDED, BROKEN AND FINALLY HOMELESS! OUR STORY OF âBENDLESS LOVEâ!

Eight days til Christmas and we have no place to go... no presents under the Christmas tree and no family to love and spoil us ? Right now we only have each other and a Christmas wish to hold onto.

Our names are Bender and Flexo. We are recent pre-holiday dumps at Brooklyn Animal Care and Control. We are 3 and 4 years old, respectively, and have not been well cared for during our lives. We are dirty with very infected ears, but are shortly being groomed and vetted so that we can go home. We are dogs with great temperaments and still have faith in people. We are both convinced that we got a raw deal and are deserving of much better. We are both neutered, microchipped, current on all shots, and also heartworm negative. Can you take us in? Two dogs are always better than one and what a start to the New Year!

Itâs hard to believe, but he is one of the lucky ones. He is lucky because he was pulled by us, sadly for so many others, they werenât so lucky. The conditions in the Southern shelters, without a hurricane, are bad. Throw in a natural disaster, and itâs 10xâs as bad. 

We were told about Charlie from some of the volunteers. It is heartbreaking to watch a dog, who had a loving home and a family, to now be alone in a cage, shaking with fear. Charlie stood out, and really stole the hearts of everyone he met. He has lived in a home with another female dog, and also with a child under the age of 12. We saw how sweet natured he was, and decided to save him. We are now seeking a foster or adopter for Charlie here in NY. He is about 4-5 years old, and weighs about 40 pounds.

991,Young,American Staffordshire Terrier,": Iâm a sucker for a sad hound dog face, and Shyloâs is near-perfect: handsome and winsome in equal measure. This gorgeous guy could break your heart and make your day with just one look! Iâm the very first stranger that day to walk him at the Care Center, and while shy in his kennel, he gradually relaxes as we stroll along. By the time weâve reach the park, his tail is softly wagging, his fly-away ears are all perked up and heâs ready to leap onto the first bench he sees. A big fan of The Three Pâs (petting, praise and Pupperoni) Shylo is all about settling down and spending some quality quiet time together, and Iâm shocked to see one of the reasons given for his surrender as âtoo strong and hyperâ. Perhaps heâs hiding an energetic puppy somewhere behind his wise old soul exterior, but I suspect the truth is that Shylo just needed more time and attention than his former owner was able to provide. He lived and played gently with a 7 year old and is said to get along well with dogs he meets on the street (as well as in our playgroups), and heâs happy to share his toys, food and space with anyone who cares to join him. Already knowledgeable in sit, stay and come commands, he walks well, seems quite house trained, and weâre told he liked to sleep with his owner and little sibling at nightâcan I get an awwww? No surprise then that sweet Shylo received high praise on his behavior assessment and is recommended for almost any homeâthe more people to love him, the better.

1015,Adult,"Whippet, Greyhound","2 Sept 2018: Phillipa (AKA Pippa) is the sweetest, most loving pup. She loves the companionship of humans. She is great with dogs of all sizes and is calm and respectful around new dogs. She has medium energy and loves to cuddle on the couch (and watch reality TV) but also enjoys daily long walks. She loves to play with toys. She is house trained and walks nicely on a leash. She cannot be crated but she is perfect when left alone and does not break or touch anything that doesnât belong to her. Her ideal family is one that can spend a lot of time with her and where she isnât left alone for very long periods of time.

Pippa can be nervous in new situations and this can make her reactions hard to predict. As such, we think she would do best with an experienced adopter who can help her overcome her fears. While she is good with children, given her fear-based reactions, we recommend a home without young children. 

Pippa is a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. She is happy in her foster home, but we know she will thrive in the stability of a forever home.

1019,Baby,American Staffordshire Terrier,"28 Sept. 2018: 

Remember the story of Eggo? This little peanut was found at 5 weeks old, weighing 2 pounds and severely malnourished. Although the odds were stacked against her, our Eggo survived and she is now a 28 pound happy puppy.

Eggo is finally ready to move to the next phase of her life. Because of the neglect she endured at a very early age, Eggo has a few quirks and she will need an understanding home that will help her and work with her. Specifically, Eggo continues to struggle with potty training and seems to have blurry vision. She is a bit protective of her food but is easily redirected. She has a short attention span and easily distracted (all those shiny objects!!!!) Eggo also enjoys running up and down the driveway as if it were her own personal treadmill. 

All in all Eggo is a joyful, silly, loving pup. She loves being rocked to sleep at nights, something her caretakers started those early nights when she was so critical. Eggo is content wherever you put her whether outside in her pen or inside in her Xpen at night. She never barks or tries to escape. Sheâs a happy pup all the time. We are looking for the perfect home for our miracle girl. She needs a home that will be both loving and firmâa home that will work with her and cherish lifeâs little victories.

We have never seen a more brindlelicious babe! He's handsome, playful, loyal, and strong. Just how we like our guys! Harrison was rescued along with two other dogs exactly a year ago from a dilapidated home filled with trash. They were abandoned for almost two weeks with no food or water, and Harrison was chained to a radiator, barely able to even lay down. His housemates have long been adopted, but this guy is still homeless, in boarding, and waiting. 
Harrison is about 3 years old, and he is a very active, energetic dog. He is strong and needs an active home where he can be kept mentally stimulated. He can live with other dogs if he is introduced properly, but it has to be the right dog. Harrison will be best in a home with older teens or adults only, definitely no cats for this blonde beauty. 

Let's share Harrison or as he's known around these parts, Handsome Harry. He needs a foster or adopter, one year is too long for any dog to be without a stable loving home.

1024,Senior,American Staffordshire Terrier,"20 Oct 2018: Apollo is still looking for a home, which is surprising to those of us that have met him in person. On paper, we understand that Apollo would be considered a difficult placement. He would be best as an only dog (strike one.) He is a senior (strike two). He is a black dog (strike three.) He is a bully breed (strike four.) But when you meet him, look into his warm chocolate eyes and take him for walk, all the doubts melt away. Apollo is simply magnificent. To meet him is to love him.

Apollo is approximately 8 years old. He is a surviver of the NY ACC system, having been surrendered because his owner lost his home and had nowhere to keep him. Apollo has lived with other dogs in the past but he is selective and our trainers do not think he can coexist with another dog. He likes to chase the kitties so no cats for this guy. He is friendly and sweet but is a strong boy and can pull on the leash. Apollo has been professionally trained so we would love to see him with a family who will keep up with his training. 

Apollo is a wonderful dog . He is warm and loving. He is medium energy and low maintenance. This big lug deserves to be in a home. Please apply to foster or adopt

1036,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"27 Nov 2016: Sheâs a little bit shy, but a lotta bit sweet! When I first approached Uniqloâs kennel, I thought she was a puppy! She had curled herself into a tight little ball on her bed, and given sheâs small as it is, her shrunken position made her look even tinier! At only about 35 pounds, she could stand to gain some weight, but even when she does, she will remain petite-a pocket pittie is how we refer to dogs like her. Though her tail was tucked, and she seemed nervous at times, with me, she was nothing but endearing. On a cold and windy day, she was eager to get close to me, maybe it was purely for warmth, but I canât help but think she was enjoying a cuddle too! She loves food and is willing to try her best to do what you ask to receive some. Uniqlo is looking for someone who will have the patience to help her come out of her shell a bit more, but a little bit of effort goes a long way with her",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41359739/1/?bust=1546360605 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41359739/2/?bust=1546360805 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41359739/3/?bust=1546360915,Nini (Acc),41359739,F,M,A
1037,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"8 August 2018: Roscoe was saved from a rural shelter just in the nick of time. This boy was a staff favorite and they called us begging to pull him and of course once we saw his smile we couldn't resist him. This boy is amazing and everyone who gets to know him simply falls in love with him. 

Roscoe is a two year old American Staffordshire Terrier mix. Heâs a solid 55lbs and has a high energy level. We recommend he be placed in an adult-only home and with no other pets. Although Roscoe is a great dog, he does have some personality quirks. He can be nervious with strangers, particularly if they are carrying mysterious objects, such as umbrellas. Roscoe's foster family has been working with him and we would encourage a potential adopter to schedule a session or two with his trainer to understand how to work with him effectively. Although Roscoe gets along well with non-confrontational dogs, we think he would do best in a home where he can get all the attention. 

Roscoe is high energy & will need a home where heâll continue to work on his exercises as he did during training. This way his energy can be controllable. He would also do best with a fur-ever family who will challenge him with new activities, daily mental & physical stimulation. He also knows the commands âsitâ, âdownâ, & walks nicely on a leash, but whomever gets him will also need to continue to work with him to maintain what he knows. He is accustomed to walking on a treadmill. So, if you are looking for a new work-out buddy then look no further. Heâs right here & his name is Roscoe.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41375122/1/?bust=1546360673 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41375122/2/?bust=1546360775 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41375122/3/?bust=1546360915,Roscoe (Black),41375122,M,M,A

1043,Adult,Miniature Pinscher,"2 Nov 2016: Hi, my name is Diesel and I am a 8 year old min pin. My life was turned upside down a few days ago when me and my sister found out that our mommy who was only 3 ... 1 years old, died suddenly and tragically. Me and Lolla were waiting for what seemed like forever for her to get home, and she never came. The next day some people we know as our moms friends came over to our house and all looked very sad. We don't know what happened, all we know is we miss our mommy so bad right now. Her friends didn't know what to do with us, but one of them remembered a thing called Second Chance Rescue, and made a phone call. We were so relived because they said that Second Chance was going to help us, and we wouldn't have to go to a ""shelter"", which we are pretty happy about. We still miss our mommy so badly, but we hope soon we will have a family and a home again. We have to leave our home today, this is a very hard day for us. We don't really know what is going on.

Please consider making a donation for lolla and Diesel. We received a call from a friend of the woman who passed away, and we couldn't say no to these 2 dogs. Their world has fallen apart in 48 hours. All they know and love is gone. Our deepest condolences to the family and friends of their mommy.

She was heartworm positive and has a cleft palate, two factors that kept getting her passed over for adoption. She is now safe with us, getting treatment for her heartworm. Her cleft palate does not affect her at all, and we think it just makes her more endearing. Snubbull gets along well with other dogs and is also OK with cats.

1075,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Jasper's boarding mom tells us: 
Generally, I go for the tall, dark and handsomes, but there's something about this dreamboat that makes me want to cross over to the other side! 
Jasper is totally my kind of guy. Confident, strong, affectionate, playful, goofy, makes me laugh... what's not to love here? He narrowly escaped being euthanized at the Manhattan shelter in June, then came down with serious pneumonia and once again was in a fight for his life. But like a champ, this babe pulled through and he is ready to find the yin to his yang. 
While Jasper is all of those wonderful things I mentioned above, he is not for a first time dog owner. He needs a capable leader who will be present and continue to provide him with mental and physical stimulation. He's no pushover and though I do play with him, he knows I am in charge at all times. He's iffy with other dogs, some we pass and he play bows, others he gets stiff so he would either need to be an only dog or interactions must take place prior to him leaving. Cats unknown and teens over 15 would be best. 
Jasper came a long way from his stay at the shelter. He is urgently in need of a foster or adopter. Remember dogs who once were in danger are still sometimes in need. Jasper is about 4 years old, UTD and neutered. 
He is located in NYC, so ask to meet him today!

1077,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd Dog","12/13/17...Sandy is a beautiful senior girl who would love to sit on the couch and enjoy TV with you. Sandy is a senior so she does go out to the bathroom often. She loves to be outside in the yard and soak up the sun, she enjoys her walks too. Sandy is looking for someone she can enjoy her golden years with, someone who can just love her, cuddle her, and make her feel like a princess. 

22 Jan 2017: Sandy is a 9 year old lab-shepherd mix. She is a well-behaved girl who would love to spend her golden years as a cherished family member. Instead, though, she landed in a kill shelter and now sits in boarding (where she has been for far too long), just hoping that someone will make her a part of their family. Sandy is a big girl, weighing about 90 lbs! And as you can see, she is a beauty. Sandy would do best in a home where there are no other dogs or a very submissive dog that is about her size. She would be an ideal match for a couple, maybe even an older couple who understand what itâs like to be aging. 

Sandy has been posted and marketed a lot but seems to keep getting passed over. It is so very sad. Wonât someone give her a chance? Sandy is located in New Windsor, NY (not too far from Poughkeepsie). Why not visit her and see if thereâs a love match? If you have another dog, you will need to bring him/her along. 

Sandy is spayed, up-to-date on all vaccinations, and is microchipped.

1081,Senior,Mastiff,"9 June 2016: He is a big mush, loves to cuddle. He was a euth list pull from Manhattan ACC, was found as a stray by the police (hence the name ""Fuzz"", lol) He was adopted out once, also in NJ, but was returned for aggression. We have not seen any severe aggression- and we have tried to see what would get a rise out of him. He plays and curls up with my two big boys (lab/ridgeback mix, shep/shar pei mix) and has no food aggression or an ... ything with them. He knows basic commands, is house trained and crate trained. He is not a big fan of the crate, but will go in on command. I don't think he would do well if crated all day. Very treat motivated, which is helpful bc he can be a little stubborn- there is no forcing this big boy to do something. He def needs a strong leader, who will be patient with slow intros etc. I feel like he is finally learning how to ""dog"", like doing things a normal dog would do- running around outside, playing with dog toys, just having fun. He does have some skin issues- scarring on his neck, possibly from embedded collar, and scarring on his muzzle, possibly from being taped/tied shut. He has some skin issues on his feet also, which the vet thinks is allergy related, and we check/clean his paws regularly",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41357666/1/?bust=1546360708 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41357666/2/?bust=1546328002 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41357666/3/?bust=1546360929,Fuzz (ACC),41357666,M,M,A

1096,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"6 Oct 2018: Hi, Chopper here! Iâm a 45lbs staffie beagle mix according to my foster familyâs best guess. I have improved so much since they took me in. I go right into my crate when they say crate time and Iâm getting more comfortable there. I have learned sit & stay and am working on lay down. I absolutely love to play catch. I am really quite good at it too. I catch almost every throw either in the air or on a bounce. I have also recently learned I can jump about 5 feet in the air. I can run several miles despite my stocky physique. I am good at short sprints and distance runs. Sometimes, when I am really excited, I can even jump over the fence after a squirrel. I still get really excited when I see other animals but I am learning to curb my enthusiasm more each day. I can get really excited when playing but if you correct me, I do listen. I try hard to be a good boy. 

I love cuddling with my foster family and their fur babies. I also like to follow you around wherever you go but I am learning to be more independent. I also really like to listen to Dave Matthews when I am super anxious, it helps me to go to sleep. 

Iâm looking for a loving, firm family who will continue to help me grow, and learn. I would love a family that will play with me a lot and take me on walks and runs so I can continue to get better on my leash manners. Please adopt me, and I will love you forever .",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42247089/1/?bust=1546360624 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42247089/2/?bust=1546360835 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42247089/3/?bust=1546360964,Chopper (ACC),42247089,M,M,A

Shadow is 10 years old and helped her former owner as an emotional support animal. She is an easy going girl who has lived with both cats and dogs and would fit in easily with just about any family.

Shadowâs foster family tells us that she is doing really well. She follows her new family everywhere in the house they go (which may be why she is called Shadow!) She gets along with the resident dogs & cats. Shadow sleeps in the bed, sometimes under the covers!! She has started playing with toys and loves chewing on ropes. She doesnât bark but seems to know speak & sit, takes treats gently, comes quickly when called, and walks well on a leash. Shadow really is the perfect dog!

1099,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"2 Sept 2018: Hi, Iâm Duppy! Iâm a 50-pound, 2 year old, boxer-pittie mix with beautiful brindle fur and white âsocksâ. I am currently living with a foster family that includes a 9-year old boy and other dogs. Not only am I a handsome cutie, Iâm a very sweet, shy guy who loves to lean-in for belly rubs! I can be a little bit nervous with new people, places and dogs at first, but if you go slow and give me time to warm up, Iâm very playful and friendly!

My foster family describes my activity level as medium; I love to play fetch with tennis balls and rope tug (I sit politely between throws!) and I really enjoy long sniffing walks and jogs. As long as I get daily exercise and things to chew (bully sticks, stuffed Kongs, marrow bones), Iâm calm inside the house and sleep through the night.
Did I mention â¦ Iâm housebroken! Unfortunately, I cannot live with cats because I like to chase (and that includes squirrels, deer and birds, too!) I walk nicely on a leash and Iâve been practicing âsit-stayâ, âdown-stayâ and âplaceâ commands through positive training.

Iâll be honest, Iâm not quite perfect yet â occasionally I will bite the leash, but this doesnât happen very often. Also, when I get over-excited, I sometimes jump and get mouthy. And I can be uncomfortable when people approach my crate (itâs called barrier frustration). But, Iâm young and if youâre willing to work with me, I learn quickly!

My foster family says I will make the perfect addition to a forever family with older children, or respectful younger children, and dog siblings would be okay! I am healthy, neutered and my vaccines are up to date. Iâm full of love and canât wait to meet you!

Tipâs former dad is in the military, and had asked his parents to take Tip in. Unfortunately due to illness, they found themselves unable to care for an energetic 2 year old dog and asked for our help. We thought we had found an adopter for Tip, but unfortunately he was too much dog for his potential family and was becoming too pushy.

Tip needs a confident owner that he can look to for direction. This boy is a big meathead who thinks he is as small as his name. His favorite spot is on your lap, especially because it put him in a perfect position for kisses. Tip looks to his handler for direction and listens well. His perfect family will have some experience and be willing to set boundaries and expectations. Tip is an extremely loving boy that will make a greatâif slightly oversizedâlap dog.

1111,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"18 Dec 2018: Pepper is a 4 year old beauty. She has had a rough start to life, when someone decided to not only clip her ears, but chopped them off. She was then given up by her family because a baby was on the way... We arenât quite sure why since Pepper LOVES kids. She is also great with people! She just sits patiently, slowly wagging her tail, as people bestow love and compliments upon her. Let's not forgot the AMAZING kisses she loves to share as well! 

Pepper loves to grab a bone and just chill out on the couch, gnawing away happily. She also loves to play tug of war, and while she does tug to win, Pepper is also fine with having her toys replaced.

Pepper is eager to learn, although she still needs to learn some basic impulse control. She walks well on leash and would make an AMAZING running companion. She just struts her stuff like a sleek moving corvette. She is also learning how to be patient and sit before her leash gets put on and before a toy is given to her, but she is just so excited to get out and play!!

Pepper can get over-excited when she sees other dogs; however with slow intros she would likely get along well with another male dog. Pepper will do best with an owner willing to put in the time to continue basic training, learning restraint, and focusing on her owner. Pepper is completely potty trained and loves to walk when she has to do her ""duty"". Pepper also does well in a crate, as long as she gets ample exercise and time out. Pepper is happiest with her people. While she loves kids and has alot of patience, given Pepperâs size (65 pounds) and energy level, she may do better in a household with older children, since she still tends to play rough because of her size. She seems a little too excited by cats and other 
fast moving critters. All in all Pepper in an adorable girl.

JoJo is a lovable and good tempered Saint Bernard mix who weighs about 105 pounds. He was fostered with another female dog in the past but has recently shown himself to be dog reactive and so we currently recommend he be an only pet. He is a sweet, handsome and calm boy that likes watching the planes and boats go by. He loves people and would make a great first mate as he loved going on boat rides with his former foster Dad. He was also happy to sit on the boat deck, getting attention and observing everyone. JoJo is a strong boy and can pull on the leash while on walks. But a lot can be forgiven for a dog that is this handsome!! We think he's a regular doggie model!!! Come one! Come all and apply for JoJo! He is a head turner for sure!

We just couldn't let such a young, vibrant dog be put down for absolutely no good reason. Calette is a young staffie, about 2 years old, spayed, up to date on all her shots, and micro chipped . She is fine with other dogs with proper introductions. She is crate trained and house broken. She has no guarding issues. Our girl, loves belly rubs and snuggles on the couch--we think she is the whole package!! Calette has so much love to give, whoever adopts her will consider themselves extremely lucky to have found such a fun, sweet, loving ,and loyal dog. And who can resist those ears !!!

A volunteer writes: Meet Bob â the Snugglemeister! Need a gentle hug? Bob, Bob heâs our man, if he canât do it no one can! Already a volunteer favorite for his gentle good manners, Bob is so delighted to give and receive hugs and kisses from all. Calm and easy, he leans in close for petting, and waits for an invitation to give a hug. Heâs so sweet he had my heart in a NY minute; for a puppy heâs incredibly calm and every once in a while breaks into puppy play reminding me that heâs still a baby! He may be housetrained âgoingâ as soon as we were out the door, doesnât mind being tethered for photos, has lovely leash manners and checks up often as we walk. Bob doesnât react to dogs passing us on our walk but loved a playful reunion with his sister, Betty, and on a play date with another female dog romped exuberantly. Bob needs a bit of TLC for his coat which is patchy in places, but good nutritious food should fix that right up. Heâs an awesome boy looking for a new home. Our behavior assessors were so impressed with him they feel he can go into a home with average dog experience. Heâs a legend in the making, so come meet him quickly.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41357624/1/?bust=1546360642 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41357624/2/?bust=1546360840 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41357624/3/?bust=1546360976,Bob (Acc),41357624,M,M,A

1122,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Meet Hutch.
This 4 year old stunner came to us as an abuse case from Louisiana. A âbaitâ dog who (now named ""Hutch"" after his finders, Tiger Hutchinson & Joanna Hutchinson) who was dumped in the middle of nowhere with a rope still hanging around his neck.
Sadly, the vet determined that this sweet boy's injuries were consistent with being dragged behind a car. He had a broken jaw, was covered in wounds, was severely emaciated and was heartworm positive. Hutch's ""owners"" clearly wanted him dead. But, he had other plans. You see, Hutch refused to die. He fought to live and he's been thanking anyone involved in his recovery with tons of kisses.
Hutch is ready for his forever home. He is a gorgeous, sweet big boy and loves to learn. He's been good with dogs, but we recommend a home with no cats.
Will you be Hutch's hero? He deserves one.

Remy is a silly, happy, Male, Catahoula Leopard Dog who is being fostered with 7 other dogs ranging in size from 6lbs - 45lbs.
He has been working on (and doing fabulously) with eating near other dogs. Remy's start was a rough one as a stray and having to fight for food to survive as a puppy. So it is important that applicants have patience and realize that Remy is receiving (and improving) with practice as a young 6 month old, however being left unattended with other animals is not something he is ready for yet.
Anyone with knowledge of WORKING BREEDS please apply for my love, Remy.
Couch potatoes, and first time dog owners...he is NOT a dog for you.
We also do not recommend Remy to families with kids under 12 as he is very active and does jump when excited. He doesn't know his own strength yet, so he may unintentionally knock over little ones.
We also do not recommend people to apply who have smaller pets (rodents), or cats as Catahoula Leopard Dogs are HUNTING breeds.

Benny was pulled off the street matted, dirty, blind with two infected eyes, and covered in parasites and worms.

Benny has been monitored closely by a very experienced foster home the last few months, and has been doing great. Benny does require daily inexpensive eye drops, and some periodic eye cleaning to keep him comfortable. Benny's favorite past times according to his foster mom are meal time, and soaking up the sun when the weather is nice.

I came all the way to NY from Arkansas after my owner was willing to surrender me after living MY ENTIRE LIFE OUTSIDE and NEVER being able to live in a house.

She is a Black Lab/Hound mix who is approximately 4 months old.

Hope MUST GO WHERE TO A HOME WHERE THERE IS ANOTHER DOG. Due to the poor condition Hope was in after we rescued her, she had to endure three life saving blood transfusions, weeks in the hospital, and two months in isolation battling parasites, pneumonia, and ring worm.

Hope has missed some opportunities to socialize without being able to be with her mother or litter mates on top of being isolated for over 2 months. She NEEDS to learn appropriate behavior from ANOTHER DOG and there will be no exception to this.

Hope is SMART. Holy cow is she smart...she also needs attention as she is puppy. For example when she eats, touches all over, food being taken and given back etc. She has not had other dogs or a mom to teach her, so this is very important to prevent guarding behaviors.

Hope is a HAPPY, energetic girl!

Angel  was adopted but returned, not because she was a bad dog, but because they had no time for her. Yet even though she was discarded twice, she hasn't lost her sweet disposition or faith in people. Angel loves to give you attention and enjoys playing. She looks forward to her walks and loves a good treat! Angel would do best in a home with no dogs/cats where she could get all your attention. Unfortunately due to her size, and probably lack of socialization prior to the shelter she would not be good in a home with any children of any age. I truly believe there is a home for every dog, and Angel will get her chance again. Please share my photos of her. This beauty needs to know what a loving home truly is.

1138,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"This sharp looking dog is Sinatra. He is a 4 year old Pittie who was found in the Bronx back in January of 2013. When he first came to us, he had no name until this sound came out of him, and it sounded like he was singing, so he became an overnight sensation under the name Sinatra. Sinatra jumps up for joy and literally bounces off his kennel walls when he sees the volunteers he has become attached to. He likes going for walks, and the walks actually calm him down. He enjoys feeling the dried leaves under his feet, and smelling the different scents in the forest. Sinatra also enjoys chewing on some bones or loves his peanut butter filled Kong toy. He needs someone who understands that he will need some training, and will work with him to help him go from a shelter dog to a pet. He is a good boy who listens when corrected and is easily trained. He is to be the only pet as he does have prey drive.

1140,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"This happy dog is Ruby, and she is so photogenic. I love taking pictures of her because she has such an aura about her. She was rescued from an abandoned house in Far Rockaway with another dog during Hurricane Sandy by fellow rescuer Christine D. Ruby is a sweetie who has a playful side to her. She is about 5 years old now, and weighing in about 40lbs. She is always happy to see you and will shower you with affection, giving kisses all over your face. Ruby has a lot of energy and could probably win an Olympic sprint! So she would make a great running or exercise partner. She is a pocket pittie and not too big so she would be perfect for any home situation. Ruby needs some training as she can be a little mouthy during play or getting too excited. She would do best as the only pet but that is even better because you'll get to spend that quality one on one time with her. Let's find Ruby a home!

Max was adopted when he was a puppy and returned as a puppy so he has spent quite a long time at the shelter. A good bone is all it takes for Max to be happy. He enjoys the comfort of a cage but would prefer a large dog bed of his own in a home. He needs someone with patience and dog experience. He also needs a home with no other pets or children. Poor Max has been waiting so patiently for his person..could you be the one?

1143,Young,"Black Mouth Cur, Boxer","Laila, a 4 year old boxer mix, is a volunteer favorite! She is shy, but extremely friendly and a delight to be around when you are invited into her world. She is a large dog, but will crawl into your lap for some love if you let her. Her absolute favorite thing to do is lay down and roll over wait for you to rub her belly! She also loves her toys and can entertain herself for hours with a rope or a bone.She has basically grown up in a shelter and should really be in a loving home that would reap the benefits of her affection. Laila reminds us of a giant greyhound. When she runs her whole body runs with gumption. She is so sleek and beautiful, and anyone would be lucky to call this beautiful girl family. The downside to Laila is that she is a little scared of new things, and her actions are based off of fear. She would need training and socialization to provide a stable environment for her.

1144,Adult,"Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Pit Bull Terrier","Ziggy was brought to us by the police back in April of 2013. He is about 6-7 years old now weighing in about 50-60lbs. Ziggy is a lover, and enjoys putting half his body on you as you can see from the pictures, and give kisses. He always has a smile on his face, and looks for his favorite people. He needs some training with the leash as he likes to grab it but in a routine, some training, and patience, this boy could easily be the best pup. He is not good with other dogs, and cats so he would need to be the only pet. I know some people want to take their dogs to the park or have doggie playdates but in all honesty its not all that it is cracked up to be.

1145,Young,Labrador Retriever,"This handsome boy is Brodie.  Brodie was adopted from HAAR as a small puppy four years ago to a family including two teenage children.  Brodie was recently returned to the rescue.  For reasons that remain unclear, Brodie developed issues with the kids in his home.  Brodie is currently in a foster home but needs a new foster or better yet, a forever home .  He has a trainer willing to work with him to address his recent trust and behavior issues.  Brodie knows several commands (sit, stay, paw, high-five), he loves to go for walks and walks well on a leash, he is housebroken and loves other dogs (meet and greet required).  Brodieâs dislikes include:  rain, being grabbed by the collar, loud noises (thunder), his nails touched, kitties and vet visits.  Brodie would do best in a quiet home with a single person, he bonds to his human and when he does he is a loving, loyal, devoted 60 lb lap dog!

1146,Adult,Boxer,"Scarlett is such a gentle spirit. She is about 4 years old who was found as a stray back in May of 2013. She will look up at you with those soulful eyes that beg you to give her some attention. Then she will rub against you to help make it easier for you to scratch her neck. She is a quiet girl who is happy to chew on a toy, go for a stroll outside, and then take a lazy nap next to you. She is strong and loves to run and play in a yard, but she also knows how to be lady like and obedient on a leash. All she wants is to find her human to love. Scarlet can be picky with dogs (it would have to be a male dog), and sometimes certain people (i always say a dog can sense an evil person). A meet and greet would definitely be in order to ensure that she would be Ok.

She was found tied to a boiler in the basement of a foreclosed house in Queens with no food or water in April of 2014. She is still young and has a lot of energy which need to be harnessed properly. Nana enjoys the outdoors whether it is going on long walks or running around in the yard, chasing the ball around. She vies for attention, and loves getting petted behind her ears. Once she knows and trusts you, she will jump straight info your arms to be carried like baby. She really needs to be in a single pet home with a someone experienced who can devote time to help train and socialize her so she can grow up to be the playful, happy dog she deserves to be. We believe she is worth the investment.

He is a lab mix who was picked up by a kind person who told us they had to use bolt cutters to get the chain off. He is about 2.5 years old now. Forrest can be affectionate, and enjoys spending time on the walks with volunteers. He loves treats but has known to be too excited. He hass some trust issues but can you blame him as his past history was probably not a pleasant one. Forrest would definitely benefit from some training. He must be the only child but will complete your family. Would not recommend him for a home with children, cats or dogs.

Scully will do best in a home with a yard, active or homebody family but one that is either willing to continue her training or understands that unless you know what you're doing.  If you're looking to ADOPT and fit this criteria then please consider Skully.  This sweet and loving redhead is an amazing family dog but she must be an only dog.  No cats, no other dogs. Her training has certainly improved her reactiveness towards other animal but the trigger is still there.  Aside from that she is perfect.

1188,Young,Hound,"Lilly, a gorgeous hound mix with Bette Davis eyes, was rescued from a high kill shelter as a puppy  and is now 5 years old going on 6.  Lilly is absolutely a sweetheart and a volunteer favorite. She likes to sniff around and play and  is apt to roll on her back for a good belly rub wherever she is. She does need boundaries and rules to follow. She's been around dogs but would do best in a home as the only dog. Meet and greet upon approved adoption application.

**Please note that our dogs may be located in foster homes around NJ and the NYC area. It would be a great help to us if you can pick up your dog from transport, (which is located in Astoria) or foster home.**

**PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IN YOUR INQUIRY** We put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them.  Please do not submit an inquiry if you are not serious about adopting.  We are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and appreciate you working with us.  For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.

All of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. After the 2 week quarantine time they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted. They are then placed on the website. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements with the waiting foster to pick the animal up from transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home once an application is being processed.

I was rescued in the nick of time from death row. I'm so cute with my salt and pepper coat and speckled ears.. but I'm still a puppy and very bouncy, energetic and fun loving. I am crate trained but I do get very attached and will cry/whine when you leave me alone at first. I still need further leash training as I pull on the leash and I'm a bit overly excited with other dogs and especially cats so NO CATS for me. I get very vocal when I see other dogs but it's because I haven't been socialized proper with them and I just am soo excited to meet them.. however I'm a bit better off leash with other dogs but I do get nervous and ""air snap"" if they get too pushy with me. Since I'm so bouncy it's best that i'm with older kids ages 12 yrs+ because I will definitely knock down toddlers and grab their toys. I need an ACTIVE person/couple/family as I would love to go running, biking, and long hikes. I'm part cattle dog so I need a job! A fenced in yard would be wonderful as I could play fetch all day with you!. I'm a silly sweet sassy girl who will give you tons of loyalty and affection if you give me the activity and social training I need! Please come meet/adopt me today!

This is TITAN.. a handsome 6/7 yr M Tan/White Amstaff/Mastiff X. He's 70 lbs of PURE HUNK O' LOVE. He's a sugar sweet big boy and loves all humans and wonderful with kids. He's good with large calm dogs but not good with small dogs and cats. Unfortunately an incident occurred where a neighbors small dog got in Titan's face barking  aggressively and Titan grabbed it and due to the extent of the injury, it did not make it. As a result due to the city ordinances, Titan had to leave the area or be euthanized. It's unfortunate and tragic what happened and no one ever wants a pet to die but accidents happen and what's even more tragic is that another dog will lose it's life for nothing more than being a dog! Still, Titan is an AMAZINGLY SWEET LOVING BOY - and he deserves a second chance!!! PLS HELP this WUGGIE WOO see another day and live his life to the fullest!!

The owner has a history of absences in and out of max life and was never taken to the vet since he was a Puppy: A few of our members came together to save him. With how emaciated and stiff jointed he was! We thought for sure he was going to be a hospice case.  To all of our surprise Max is a crazy, lively, fun loving dude. He loves a good adventure and is an even better love bug/cuddler NOW that heâs feeling better. 

YES max still has a fatal liver condition BUT his last days are not any time soon! This little lover is living life to his fullest and would love a forever partner to go through life with him. 

Someone please step up to give him the best golden years a dog can ask for!! 

** if you foster OR adopt his monthly medicine expenses will be paid for **

He is on 2 medications indefinitely : Denamarin & Prednisone and Cosequin vitamins which all older adults/seniors should be on for joint and bone support.

We pray someone has a heart for his story the same way he stole everyone at ACCâs heart away and melted us with his dreamy eyes.

1229,Adult,"Doberman Pinscher, Rottweiler","Izzy is a Rottweiler/Doberman mix that came into the rescue with a severe heart condition. After many doctors visits and expensive testing, she was diagnosed as having aortic stenosis. This condition refers to the narrowing of the aortic value, which puts undue stress on the heart. Unfortunately, Izzy is not currently a candidate for surgery or medication. However, our vet recommends that she be reassessed when she reaches maturity for a more definitive prognosis. At this time, it will also be determined whether or not she can be spayed.

Despite her condition, Izzy looks and acts like a typical pup. She gets along well with other animals and has been well-socialized with children. Before applying for Izzy, please research the condition and consider the financial commitment that will be associated with her adoption. Large breed experience is also preferred.

1265,Baby,Pit Bull Terrier,"Hi everyone! I'm Jazzy! 

I was left at an adoption drive in Union Square one Saturday, but it was the best thing that happened to me because it's helped me to make lots of friends! However, finding my forever family would be the REAL best thing! My human friends tell me I am the smartest puppy in all the land: I know tons of commands like sit, down, stand, paw, look, and more! I promise that you won't meet a more brilliant puppy, and if you bring me home, you WON'T be disappointed. 

While I'd LOVE a foster home, what I REALLY want is a forever home!! Can it be with you?! I love to run around and play with other pups, but I get really excited by cats. My absolute favorite activity is playing with my squeaky toys, and I can't wait to show you just the right way to do it! Follow me on Instagram @findjazzyahome, and if you like to take pictures, come take some of me that I can share! I don't have opposable thumbs to take them of myself...

PS, I am spayed and fully vetted. I'm told that's an important detail to share!

1267,Adult,Staffordshire Bull Terrier,"Say hello to Moe, one of the cutest, friendliest dogs you will ever meet. Abandoned at a local high-volume shelter, this sweet five year old Staffie mix was on the list to be euthanized. Mighty Mutts got there in the nick of time and eventually found him a forever home. However, his mom is no longer able to take care of him. Mighty Mutts stepped right in again, and now Moe is enjoying his foster home along with his foster dad and his dadâs dog Bugsy, a Mighty Mutts alumni (see pictures of the two of them snuggling above).

After spending some time with him, we discovered Moe is completely deaf. Despite his disability and the trauma of moving from the home he knew to his foster home, Moe is a sweet mush who likes nothing more then either playing with his foster brother or snuggling next to his foster dad. What would make him even happier is a forever home of his own! 

Moe is about 60 pounds. He gets along great with people and dogs that he knows. Moe does not get along with cats. He can have some anxiety on leash (most likely due to his deafness) and a bit of separation anxiety as well.

1272,Young,Mixed Breed,"Turkey was rescued as a puppy from a kid, who tried to strangle Turkey with a very tight rope around his Neck. He was shivering because of the trauma and confusion. After awaiting a long time to find an escort parent, he is finally in the US. He is adjusting well in his foster home. We noted few rashes on the skin which is due to lack of vitamins and rough flooring in the shelter back in Egypt. However, his fur and skin is already starting to look much better. With some TLC and good nutritious food, he will be a completely different dog. He is good with kids, cat and other dogs. He has webbed feet for walking in sand, a great beach and dune walker. Turkey is currently in a foster home in NYC, and he is neutered and fully vetted.

1273,Young,Black Mouth Cur,"""Hi everyone, My name is Riley! Iâm a big boy with an even bigger heart looking for a forever home. Despite my size I am still just a pup; Iâm a 2 year old, neutered, Black-Mouth Cur mix. I am in great health and up to date on my shots. Iâm full of energy and I love to go on walks and play play play. I do tend to pull on my leash when I see other dogs but only because I love to make new dog friends. Did I mention that I am also a dancer? Whether I know you or we just met I have a habit of jumping up and trying to do a little tango. When Iâm not trying to bust a move I love to cuddle and lay around the house. Like all dogs, Iâm a cutie, but Iâm not perfect. I must admit that I am possessive over my toys and sometimes I take things that are not mine. I have been experiencing some growing pains recently, and Iâve outgrown my current home. Iâm looking for a new owner who has some experience training a high-energy pup like myself.

My dream forever home would be with someone or with a couple, preferably without small children, who can dedicate themselves to working with me and guiding me to become the best boy I can possibly be.  From the tips of my buttery soft ears all the way down to my big doofy paws I know I am good boy and I can be an even better boy in time. It would mean the world to me if you could contact my dear friend Caryn about adopting me! Sheâs very friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have about me. You can call or text her at 845-372-8534 or email her at cbyllott@gmail.com.

I hope to hear from you soon! Have a pawsome day!""

1274,Adult,Poodle,"Ellie is a recently rescued eight-year-old poodle mix. Her mom passed away after a long illness, and her sister was going to take her to a local kill shelter if no one took her off her hands. Ellie is now being fostered in the East Village. Despite the fact she is still recovering from an emotional ordeal, Ellie is showing she will be a really special dog. She gets along with cats and is learning to get along with dogs as well (there are both in her foster home). She is housebroken and walks well on the leash. Ellie is starting to experience the first  moments of love, kindness, and affection she has had in a long time. Plus look how cute she is!

1276,Adult,"Boxer, Pit Bull Terrier","ERIKA  She is 3 years old  60 pounds  Mixed Breed Female  Spayed

ERIKA found herself at the Brooklyn NYACC as a stray.  Her time was up and she was placed on the euthanisa list.  An amazing person stepped up to save her life and now she's ready to embark on the next phase...adoption!


ERIKA is good with all people and Loves strangers to say hello to her.  She seems to like other big dogs, gets overly excited with small dogs, and wants to chase cats and Squirrels on the Street. Introduction to other dogs should be very slow.
She is housetrained and likes to go for walks about 3-4 times a day.  She pulls some on the leash when she first goes outside until she reaches her spot to relieve herself.   She is not paper trained, and u have never placed her in a crate. 

My wish for ERIKA is to be placed with a fun, Loving, and energetic family that will include her in their daily lives.  She Loves being with her human, and has been great since the second day that I had her.  She Loves sitting beside me and will follow me around my home.  An affectionate and loving family would be ideal as she loves giving and getting hugs, kisses, belly rubs, and having  under her chin rubbed. Patience and observation would be ideal as i believe she has much more to offer, and her past is still unknown.

Erika is extremely smart and knows many commands.  She knows Sit, down, Wait, give me your paw, high five, give me a kiss, and lie down.  She Loves to play ball daily for about 15 -20 minutes. She will retrieve the ball and bring it back to your lap waiting for you to say Drop It.  

Erika can open a door if not closed properly, and also open the refrigerator.  When left alone for too long she helped herself to chicken fingers,  hot dogs, and mozzarella cheese.  She has the most adorable putty face when she thinks she is in trouble.

She does not like loud noises or loud barking dogs.  She is very sensitive to loud noises.

I absolutely Love Erika and wish that I could keep her without hesitation.  I, unfortunately, have loud barking little dogs.

NO SMALL ANIMALS.

1289,Senior,Pomeranian,"Meet the newest little old man to join the Rescue City Family: TEDDYBEAR ?

At just 8.4 pounds, this 8-10 year old Pomeranian was brought into the NYC ACC as a stray in terrible condition, with matted fur and long nails that were digging into his tiny paws. Our wonderful fosters helped us pull this boy as soon as we posted the plea to save him. This adorable boy got the grooming he desperately needed, and in just two short days his personality has surely started to blossom in his foster home! 

Teddy? loves to eat, loves attention, but is also ok just hanging out on his own. Although he does need some help in the potty department, we think it will be an easy fix! If youâre interested in being Teddybearâs forever family, apply to adopt at www.rescuecity.nyc

Santa Paws is a jolly pup whoâs only Christmas wish is to find his forever home! Frosty is a stunning spotted little guy who is learning commands, manners and potty training in his foster home. 

We think this lab mix litter is mixed with some terrier and/or hound. Santa Paws is currently 7 weeks old and a tiny 6 pounds! He will be 45-55 pounds full grown. He will be fully vetted, vaccinated and neutered and ready for his forever home soon. These happy, jolly pups will do great in any home including one with other animals and children, which continues to keep them socialized and active!

Puppies are currently in their foster home and receiving all their vaccinations, and have neuter/spay appointments scheduled. They are able to go into foster to adopt homes if you are willing to take them to the vet to finish their shots or they can go into an adopters home once they have been fully vaccinated and spayed.

1291,Young,Shepherd,"Meet ADOPTABLE STORMI. This gorgeous young dog is finally getting a chance to love life.

Stormi was abandoned, hit by a car, left for dead and no one ever came looking for her. Then someone brought her into a shelter, we pulled her as fast as we could and she had a successful FOH surgery + medical boarding + rehab until she was ready to make her way here.

Stormi is BLOOMING into a completely different dog thanks to her foster mom Alycen. The world is still a scary place to Stormi, but sheâs gaining more confidence in herself and humans, every day. She loves being outside, running and going on walks. Sheâs beginning to give kisses and is so affectionate. She will nudge you to rub her belly and never stop!

Stormi needs a strong leader who she can build a bond with, she is very smart and just craving to be loved. She is crate trained and house trained, fully vetted and spayed. 

Stormi is 2.5 years old and 48 pounds with a beautiful coat and piercing eyes. She is opening up to dogs a little bit more but should be the only dog in the home, and would not be a good fit for a home with kids at this time either, exceptions for homes with other dogs will only be made if you have extensive shepherd breed experience. 

Apply to adopt this beauty at www.rescuecity.nyc, we only set up meet and greets once there is an approved application on file, please email dana@rescuecity.nyc with any questions, and please SHARE Stormi! There is no doubt that she will make someone very happy!

NOVA,  which is Latin for new, has come a long long way since she arrived here back in August, once found terrified in the middle of the woods (#RCNova), she has completely blossomed and broken out of her shell. Nova LOVES people, she absolutely LOVES playing with other dogs, LOVES her toys, is crate trained and house trained. So how is it that a dog as beautiful and perfectly mannered as Nova is still looking for her forever?

Nova is about one year old and 45 pounds. She will be great in any household including one with children and other dogs. She will be the perfect dog to go on long hikes with, or cuddle up to you on cold day. Nova is available for adoption in NY, NJ, CT & PA.

Rudolph is a handsome little guy who is learning commands, manners and potty training in his foster home. He is fostered with hist lettermate and kids, and is good with all dogs and children! His foster parents are compeltley obsessed with him and say he is such a smart boy!

We think this lab mix litter is mixed with some terrier and/or hound. Frosty is currently 7 weeks old and a tiny 6 pounds! He will be 45-55 pounds full grown. He will be fully vetted, vaccinated and neutered and ready for his forever home soon. These happy, jolly pups will do great in any home including one with other animals and children, which continues to keep them socialized and active!

Puppies are currently in their foster home and receiving all their vaccinations, and have neuter/spay appointments scheduled. They are able to go into foster to adopt homes if you are willing to take them to the vet to finish their shots or they can go into an adopters home once they have been fully vaccinated and spayed. 
To apply to adopt this little mush submit an application at www.rescuecity.nyc, we only set up meet and greets once we have an approved application on file! Frosty is up for adoption in NY NJ CT and PA!

1297,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"According to his foster mom Roc is your typical happy go lucky puppy. He enjoys playing at doggie daycare and getting love from his family.

Roc is crate trained, house trained, loves people and other dogs and mostly walks nicely on a leash. 

Roc would do best in a home that was the time to continue his training and the energy to keep up with his level of activity. Roc would love a doggie sibling.

1298,Adult,Beagle,"Daisy is a sweet six-year old (42 pound) Beagle mix looking for her forever home. Her family were unable to keep her due to our changing family dynamic and living situation. She would do great in a house with outdoor space so she can run around chasing squirrels and birds. She  also gets along well with other dogs and loves to showcase her speed and playfulness. This cute girl enjoys hiding bones outside, eating leftovers, and acting as the official defender of the home. Currently, Daisy is eating prescription dry food, but on occasion  is  fine with clean table food â what dog wouldnât be! She also likes being a clean smelling dog, and is use to getting groomed once a month.

Daisy knows basic commands such as sit, down, paw, and high five. Excited by everything and everyone she sees, she sometimes pulls when walked, so she mostly does her business in the yard.

She is used to sleeping in a dog bed and on occasion, can also be crated.

Because Daisy appears to be more comfortable around men, we recommend a home where her main guardian would be a dog-loving man. If there are children in this home, it is suggested they be over 12 years of age.

If you would like to meet Daisy please contact admin@lovingtouchrescue.org

1301,Baby,Greyhound,"Turkey arrived in the US from Egypt. This handsome doggy is around 10 months old and great with dogs, cats and kids. He is trained in Arabic and is making English translations. Cats and kids are seen as playmates. He has webbed feet for walking in sand, a great beach and dune walker. He is looking for a forever home, if you want to meet him and give him a forever home, please contact adoptions@foranimalsinc.com.
His story: Turkey was rescued as a puppy from a kid, who tried to strangle Turkey with a very tight rope around his Neck. He was shivering because of the trauma and confusion. After awaiting a long time to find an escort parent, he is finally in the US. He is adjusting well in his foster home. We noted few rashes on the skin which is due to lack of vitamins and rough flooring in the shelter back in Egypt. However, his fur and skin is already starting to look much better. With some TLC and good nutritious food, he will be a completely different dog. We would love to see this baby go to a forever home.

1303,Young,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Misty was saved from an upstate shelter where she was not being properly cared for. She is now in foster care in Passaic County, NJ, and is need of a responsible Forever home. Here's a bit more about this beautiful girl: 

My name is Misty and there is something magical about me! I wake up happy every morning and stay that way all day! This easy-going girl has a joyful, calming energy that is contagious, and makes everyone around her feel happy and relaxed. Misty is 5-years-old, loving, silly, smart and listens very well to her obedience commands. She is polite, quiet and completely house-trained. 

Misty will sleep in if you let her and does a great couch potato, but is also athletic, and loves to play fetch, swim and go for walks or hikes. She is a true love bug that enjoys belly rubs and giving kisses -- she adores humans of all ages!  Misty weighs about 55-lbs and although she doesn't throw her weight around, would do best in a home with older children. Misty is dog selective, so needs to be your one and only, but she is honestly all the pet anyone needs! 

So, if you're looking for a practically perfect companion, who will love you like there is no tomorrow, and is the exact opposite of a pain-the-butt, then Misty is your girl!

1306,Adult,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Chocolate Labrador Retriever","Browny was first found as a terrified stray behind a dumpster in July. It turned out, his original family gave him to a âfriendâ that let him go! ? Two months later, he was adopted to a family that claimed theyâd love him forever. A week later he was returned because they âkept him in a room that he would try and break out of.â ? Thankfully, he was adopted shortly after by a local loving family where he enjoyed his backyard, new canine brother, and young human sibling to play with. Unfortunately, due to unexpected changes in the household, Browny returned to us last week. ?

Browny absolutely deserves a permanent home. He may be 7yrs old, but he is as energetic and playful as a young pup. He LOVES people, doesnât seem to mind most dogs, and doesnât like cats. He would do great in most homes with a strong handler. PLEASE help Browny find his final home! Meet him during daily adoption hours Mon-Fri 2pm-5pm, Wed 2pm-6pm, Sat-Sun 1pm-5pm.

I'm a bit of a puller on the leash so still need some leash training and help with basic commands but I'm eager to please and food motivated so I will make a good student. I'm good with dogs but I'm a little too interested in cats. I think I would be fine with older kids ages 7 yrs +
If you want an adorabull itty bitty pitty in your life.. pls come meet me today!

I'm not sure what my mix is but I could definitely pass for a mini Wirehaired German Shorthaired Pointer. I have long legs and a lean body and am quick as a whip and can fly like the wind! I'm very agile and can jump straight up on tables and am an expert fetcher! I am being rehomed due to my high energy level and need to be out in the country chasing squirrels and going on long hikes and runs. I am super friendly, fun loving and have very happy go lucky energy!! I am great with other dogs but I like to steal balls and toys. I think I would be ok with assertive cats but I will want to chase a skittish one. I need someone/couple/family that is VERY ACTIVE and love to be outdoors. I am a bit jumpy so children ages 7yrs + would be best. One of my vices is that I am a ""flight risk"" and if you leave your door open or don't latch the gate,  I am ""gone with the wind""!!! A secure at least 6 ft fully fenced in yard is mandatory and another active dog would be preferred to keep my activity level in check. I would be an excellent candidate for agilty training and would excel at it! If you're an active fun loving person and want a 4 legged non-stop bundle of silly rabbit...I'm the dog for you!!

I was found as a stray and my owner was never found. No one knows my past,  but I definitely was not treated well because I'm extremely hand shy and skittish when I first meet new people and I will back up when you try to touch me. Once I get to know you, I'm more trusting but you must go slow with me. I'm also nervous walking on a leash alone and zig zag, but I walk much better with another dog. I love other dogs and come alive when I'm with another dog so I MUST GO WITH ANOTHER DOG preferably a bigger dog to give me a sense of comfort and security. The playful puppy comes out in me when I'm in the company of dogs. I'm fine with cats too! Because I'm so hand shy, it's best if I go with older kids/teens ages 12 yrs+. I need someone/couple/family to give me the patience and compassionate support to make me more confident and secure and I will be a SPARKLING LIL' GEM in no time!! Pls come meet me today!!

1320,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"We're just going to come out and say it - Suki is pretty much perfection. Suki means 'to love' in Japanese and boy does she live up to that name; she loves everyone! At 9 years young, Suki is just about the happiest dog you could meet. She isn't crated in the home, is housebroken, a wonderful leash walker and loves meeting new pups and people. Her favorite things to do are play with her stuffed animals, poke around the park and ask people for belly rubs and hugs. Suki is looking for a family who has lots of time to spend with her or wants a dog they can bring anywhere. She would also love another low-key dog to live with. Suki is 64 pounds and should be approximately 55 pounds - she has lost over 10 pounds in her foster home and will need to continue her weight loss journey in her adoptive home to be her healthiest self.

This gorgeous pup made his way to us after surviving a kill shelter, and is now ready to find his forever home. Drago was a little confused by a leash and collar when he arrived at his foster momâs house, and was pulling a lot on walks. After just a few days with the appropriate harness, and some basic leash training, Drago is now perfectly manageable on walks and boy does he love them! This handsome guy is extremely sweet, soliciting attention wherever he can get it, yet is perfectly quiet when crated or in a pen. Drago loves to play with other dogs, and is sometimes a little too forward when trying to initiate play with his smaller foster siblings. That being said, he is very accepting of other dogsâ correction and does not become aggressive when another dog tells him to back off. Drago is great with people, kids included. He gets very excited when you first come home and will jump up to say hello, but as long as youâre willing to continue setting boundaries, Drago would make a perfect family dog. Apply today to add this goofy guy to your family, you wonât regret it!

But she is also house-trained, crate-trained and does enjoy long naps at home. At home, she doesnât chew or bark, and loooves cuddles. Trinity can get a bit startled by fast-walking New Yorkers and may feel over stimulated by squirrels or other dogs â nothing that a little obedience training will not deal with: she is eager to please.

1347,Adult,Labrador Retriever,"Hello! Looking for a sweet brown eyed girl who just needs to be your shadow during every one of your movements? Look no more, here is Charlotte! Char is a 2 year old black lab mix. I have been fostering her for a while and can see a huge difference in her from the first day she came to stay with us. Charlotte is a little timid and definitely needs a patient person to show her that humans aren't awful. She trusts easily, and is very food motivated so she will be easy to train. My guess is that she was a stray pup down south and had a litter of puppies. She was very confused when I brought her into our home, as she didn't understand what a TV was or why she wasn't allowed to sit on the windowsill. Charlotte will pee outside and poop off leash without a problem. We are slowly but surely learning that being on a leash is okay, and that no one is going to hurt her. It will help if she has a confident friend in the home, but she also would be fine on her own. She plays with my 5 month old Chihuahua mix and plays tug of war with my 80lb lab. She gets slightly aggressive around feeding time but I am sure this is because she doesn't know if her next meal is certain. She is full of love and will lean her head into you as soon as you pet her. She will even paw you for more pets if you dare stopping! She is a sweetheart who is also goofy. She loves her toys and will love to keep you company.

1364,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"About three years ago, we rescued a young puppy that was dragged around brutally by a man. The man was kicking and yelling at the dog, threatening to kill him. Julian was about 6 months old then. Two boys, (about 11-13 years old ) were walking by and when the man asked if they wanted the dog, they said yes- even at such a young age, the boys knew that they must act on this horrific treatment of a sentinel being. Unfortunately, their mother didnât allow them to bring the pup home, and so the two boys were walking on the street, asking strangers to help them with the dog. After many long hours of searching for help, one of our volunteers saw the two boys with the pup, and offered to help. This is how Julian ended up in the AMA family. After a couple of months with us, Julian has been adopted into a wonderful family who later moved to South Carolina and for three years heâs been living there. Unfortunately, due to the difficult circumstances, the family wasnât able to keep Julian and so recently Julian came back to us. He is now looking for an experienced adopter with no other pets. Julian is a great dog who deserves to have his happily ever after, and we are hoping that with your help, he will get it.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41095302/1/?bust=1535407284 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41095302/2/?bust=1535407284 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41095302/3/?bust=1535407285 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41095302/4/?bust=1535407288 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41095302/5/?bust=1535407289 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41095302/6/?bust=1535407289,Julian,41095302,M,L,A

The owner's friend was coming to feed Chops once a day for months, but he had to spend two hours daily to get it done and he also knew that he won't be able to continue doing that for much longer. When all seemed lost, the owner's friend reached out to us with the desperate plea for help. When we heard the story we couldn't turn him down, and so we welcomed Chopes into the AMA family.

I am originally from Texas, but due to unfortunate circumstances I wasnât able to find my forever home there, and it was decided that I had a better chance in finding my happily ever after on the other side of the country. It's only been about a month, but I consider myself a true New Yorker now. I love the people and the vibe, all the smells and noises- even though they are much busier than Texas- all of it makes me feel right at home! I am as active as any New Yorker, I like to spend my time outside and interact with my friends, human and furry ones alike. But my favorite of them all is a small human who I consider my best friend! My foster parents say I am obsessed with kids, which is so totally true! Little humans just get me. I am extremely social and can't wait to learn all the dog-rules on how to be a perfectly behaved doggie. My real mom was 35 lbs, and she was a mixed breed. No one knows about my father, so I hope you don't mind that it's hard to identify my breed. One thing I know for sure is that I will give you so many kisses that you wouldn't ever care for my breed.

1369,Adult,Chihuahua,"We've noticed Prince when we visited a local kill-shelter. He was cowering in a back of a cage, shaking like a leaf. When we lingered by his cage we realized that he wasn't like other dogs, and after taking a closer look we realized that poor Prince was partially blind. All he can see is shadows, but nothing more. That is why he was so scared and confused at the shelter, too many new smells and noises, and no way for him to know what is going on. We pulled him immediately and placed him with an experienced foster who dealt with special needs dogs before. It took Prince only two days to adjust to his new surrounding and a true royal personality started coming out. It didn't take him a week until he started bossing around his foster mom and her dog. There is nothing more he prefers than to cuddle with his human, and seems that he likes to be carried around in a bag when outside. A loud street could be scary for him, but he doesn't mind a quite outside area to do his business and run around. Because Prince still sees shadows he doesn't bump into things and moves around his house with a confidence you wouldn't expect from a dog that's been through so much. But Prince is a fighter and we can't wait to find his forever home so that he can be spoiled rotten there.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43491863/1/?bust=1544289517 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43491863/2/?bust=1544289524 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43491863/3/?bust=1544289531 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43491863/4/?bust=1544289538 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43491863/5/?bust=1544289546 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43491863/6/?bust=1544289558,Prince,43491863,M,S,A
1370,Young,"Pit Bull Terrier, Mixed Breed","Rascal was abandoned and tied up under the blazing sun. Local cops found him in a parking lot, looking defeated. He was so thin and frail that an officer lifted what should be a strong, majestic pit bull with one arm like a feather. They took him to The Veterinary Emergency and Referral Group, where he awaited transport to a high kill shelter. The employees at VERG knew his fate at the kill shelter, so they called us up and asked us to take the case. Remembering other pit bulls that we took care of like Norman and Lola, we knew that Rascal could have the same happy ending and we would be betraying our duty as rescuers to turn him away from that chance. We welcomed him to the AMA family and rushed him to our vets at Noah's Ark Veterinary Practice to see what was going on with this poor dog of just skin and bones. Based off of the medical exam we were able to tell that he had been through a lot of trauma, especially for his young age. He developed deep pressure wounds from being pressed against the walls of a small space for a long time and was also covered in dozens of other wounds that resembled bite marks. Weeks in medical boarding Rascal's playfulness started to come out. It was time for him to leave the clinic and go to a foster home. We were so excited to watch Rascal thrive and eventually getting adopted. But unfortunately, that wasn't his happily ever after. A year later his adopters returned him to us as they were no longer able to care for him. It was a very sad news, but we didn't give up Rascal then and we are not about to give up on him now.

She is house broken, has a good appetite and gets well with other dogs, cats and kids. She is easy going and a pleasure to foster! She is overall very healthy except for a dry eye condition on her left eye requiring daily eye drops. She is spayed and up to date on all her vaccines.

1382,Young,Terrier,"Frankie is a super fantastic little guy! He is approximately 3 years old, neutered and current on his vaccines. Frankie weighs about 13 lbs. He would be a good fit in many different homes. This little guy is so entertaining to watch, his antics are endearing. Big dark lovely eyes and the funniest coat I have ever seen. Frankie is crate trained and walks beautifully on a leash. Car trips and adventures would be a no brainer with this turn key pup. Frankie will do well in a home with older children and no other pets.

Dexter is good with other dogs and OK with cats, he is just curious, they hiss and he leaves them alone.

1384,Adult,Chihuahua,"Justin was so scared in the shelter, never showed aggression just shook in the corner. Slowly he would walk over in the kennel to look for people and wag his tail, just wanting someone to take him out of there. We pulled him from shelter in NJ because we couldn't bare to have them there for one more day. He is thriving in his foster home and full of confidence and loves to be loved. He is approx 9 years old but full of spunk and life. He gets along with everyone, people, dogs, cats. Because of his size, he is nervous aound young children, so children over 13 years old is a must. He will bark at bigger dogs until he gets to know them. He now thinks he is the boss. LOL

Nico is a beautiful tan color, he is approx 7 years old and tiny at about 4 lbs. He is neutered and up to date on shots, and gets along with dogs and cats.

1390,Senior,"Chihuahua, Miniature Pinscher","Vita is our senior (maybe 10 years old) chihuahua/min pin mix.  She was surrendered to a shelter near us because someone in the family was allergic, and when we heard about her we had to go get her.

Vita is so sweet and lovely.  She is quite spunky for a senior and loves to go for walks.  

Vita is easy to care for and easy to love.  She is wee wee pad trained (just #1) and also does her business outside.  

She can live with other dogs, but likes to chase kitties, so a no cat home would be best for her.  

Vita needs a forever home that understands senior dogs.  

She is available to homes on Long Island and in Queens, NY.

1391,Senior,Havanese,"We rescued Andy and Cody from their home where they had been left behind after their dad died and their mom tried to commit suicide.  They had been unintentionally neglected for years due to physical and mental illness of their parents.  

Andy is 17.5 years old.  Cody is 16.5 years old.  They are pure breed Havanese.  

They must be adopted together.  We are open to a forever foster situation for these boys as well.  

Andy and Cody are so sweet and easy to care for.  They will need someone that understands senior dogs and loves them tremendously.  We would love for them to have a fenced in back yard so that they have the ability to enjoy the outdoors without having to be walked.  

The boys are in pretty good health given their age and what they have been through.  Cody has some hearing and visual impairment and Andy has arthritis.  

Metabolically they are in fine shape, and they eat like horses!

Rhett is a great dog - friendly, happy and in good health.  We have fully vetted him and he is in really good shape.  He may be 11 years old, but he acts more like he is 6-7 years old.

Rhett would fit well into most homes. He just needs a friend, a couple of walks a day, and a nice sofa to chill on.

1395,Senior,Chihuahua,"Ralph is a senior chihuahua that we rescued from Hempstead Shelter. He and his sister Rita were found and brought into the shelter.  They were so sad while there and clearly needed TLC, having been neglected and we believe dumped in the street.

They have been fully vetted and are now ready for their home.  They must go to the same forever home since they are bonded.

Ralph can remain a foster while Rita can be adopted.  Ralph is on heart medication which we will cover.  He also has bladder stones that may cause him to have urinary issues.  He is not a candidate for surgery.  We will cover his medical care for life.

1401,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Beautiful 6-year-old Buttercup was pulled from a high-kill shelter,  put into boarding, and when the group who originally pulled her could not afford the boarding, surrendered her to PAWS.
Buttercup has been waiting for a home for a long time.  Though she does not like to be bothered by other animals, and would have to be the only pet in the home, she IS sweet, loving and appreciative of the person who will give her a chance to live in a home where she can have access to a yard.  Buttercup can be protective of her person, so a quiet home would be best. She loves the kiddie pool in the warmer weather, and a nice yard would be perfect for her to chase balls and ""dive"" into the pool :)

1402,Senior,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Siberian Husky","Sweet senior Winslow was able to spend this past summer in a home where he was very much loved. The family, sadly, was unable to keep him but did give us a lot of great information about him, and we are all hoping that someone will see him and give him the forever home he so deserves.
Some background info: Winslow, about 7-8 years old, was rescued when animal control from an inner city pound was called about a dog left abandoned in a garage.  He was with us for a long while before going to spend the summer with a family in NYC.  They found that the city's pace, though they reside in a quieter neighborhood, is probably too much for Winslow and he became very anxious.  
In the house, Winslow is very comfortable, very sweet, cuddly and affectionate.  He does have a hard time with people or dogs he does not know coming into the home. He enjoys retreating into his crate to just chill out or nap. He only chews his own toys, and never destroys anything in the home.  He doesnât always want to release his toys, so having an extra ball or toy to switch out is good, and we recommend an adult home.  
Winslow is a sweet, affectionate and loyal dog who would do well in a quiet home where he is the only pet. A fenced yard would be great to give him exercise space without having to deal with other dogs on walks, though he does well on leash now. He has the most endearing face and his coat is beautiful and soft.  This boy has waited a long time to find the right home -- please consider him!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34923971/1/?bust=1472766338 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34923971/2/?bust=1472766339 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34923971/3/?bust=1482877720,Winslow,34923971,M,M,A
1403,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"HAPPY got his name because when we rescued him from the shelter he was nothing but smiles. 

At just 1-2 years old, Happy is a gorgeous 57 pounds with the most stunning green eyes. Happy shares his current foster home with another bully breed who is much bigger than he and the two get along famously. 

Even though he is a happy boy, Happy is scared of new things and will cower if you raise your hand too quickly. Happy is the poster-child for pit bull myths as this boy is nothing but gentle and sweet. If anything he's the one who's reluctant to trust us. Slow and steady wins the race with Happy.

Happy is housebroken, loves car rides and walks well on the leash, only pulling when he is real interested in something.

1404,Adult,"English Bulldog, Staffordshire Bull Terrier","Faith is a beautiful, sweet and laid back dog!  She is probably between 7-9 years old.  She is easy going and loves to just hang out with her people.  Faith had been adopted last year, after PAWS pulled her from an overcrowded city shelter, but unfortunately the adopter was assigned a new post where he must travel for weeks at a time, and though his family tried to fill in, it just became evident that Faith would need to be rehomed. They were so disappointed because they adored her!  We feel Faith would be happiest leading a quiet life, and though she is good with everyone and good with other dogs, she is at the stage in her life where she really doesn't engage in too much play with them, and just loves to hang out, to sleep, and to eat. What could be better?! And she is an easy walker!  Although at times she does have a little spunk in her!  Watch her video! Sheâs a cutie!

1405,Adult,Chihuahua,"ABIGAIL is an 8 pound, 3 year old female Chihuahua. Abby is a high energy girl that loves to play and loves to go for walks. When she isn't outside, she loves to sit at the window and watch all of the neighborhood happenings. She has a habit of chasing the cats in her foster home, so no cats for her. 

Abby is wee wee pad trained and also knows how to use the bathroom outside. Since she was abandoned at the shelter at half the weight she is now, she LOVES food and treats (even fruits and vegetables). At dinner time, she eats her food in one fell swoop!

Abby does not care for baths, loud noises and yelling. All these things terrify her. She bonds quickly with people and is especially fond of her foster dad. At night, she is happy to sit with you while you watch TV and snooze quietly by your side until bedtime. At bedtime, Abigail likes to cuddle and sleep right next to you under the blankets. She sleeps all night quietly by your side.

Abby would absolutely love a home in which her person is home with her a lot, as she craves companionship and attention. Abigail is spayed, up-to-date on shots and microchipped. To meet her please go to our website and fill out an application: www.beastlyrescue.org/application

1406,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Beautiful Piper came to PAWS from a large city shelter where volunteers advocated for her hoping to get her out. She is in a great foster home, and is sweet, quiet and easy. She is fine to spend time by herself without being destructive (and she will go into a crate easily if necessary). We estimate her age to be approximately 6-7 years.  
Piper loves being outside in the yard where she can scout for whatever, and will come when called. She is totally housebroken and non-destructive if left alone. She is a strong girl, but she is remarkably calm with children, and she is very sweet when meeting people of all ages.  She is good when new people come in and out, but she will alert you if she hears something she is unsure of outside. She is loving, she listens, and she is smart. She will follow you around the house, but when it's time for sleep, she takes herself to her bed and is fine for the night!  And like many bully breeds, she is a snorter, so sometimes it sounds as if she is growling when, in fact, she is just excited (or just breathing lol) and snorting. She has happily greeted everyone she's met at her foster homes. She is also awesome in the car and will sit quietly for 5 minutes or 2 hours -- she loves the ride. She loves to walk, is energetic outside, and takes in everything as she trots along. She would run with you if you let her. 
We have not tested her with other animals while in foster as she has been through a lot and seems to be very happy with her quiet and calm environment and her people. 
Piper has been thoroughly vetted -- she has had some medical issues that our vets have treated, and her prognosis is excellent.  She has not had an easy life -- her teeth are ground down and she obviously had litters of pups during her life, but she is so appreciative of a comfortable bed and regular meals!  
Piper looks forward to being a wonderful companion for anyone looking to adopt an older, easy dog who doesn't ask for much. She is a joy to care for.

1416,Adult,"Poodle, Dachshund","JP is a 5 year old, 15 pound Poodle mixed with Doxie. This is our best guess because if you met JP when we rescued him, there was no way of knowing what breed he was. We usually spare adopters the gory details of the condition of the dogs we rescue, but not to know JP's story would do him a disservice.

JP was grotesquely matted, severely overweight and had a mouth full of rotten teeth. It has taken months of care to get JP to where he is at (both emotionally and physically) today.

A little bit about JP: he has eyes that melt your heart. He's the kindest dog that is so, so grateful. He knows he's been rescued and he is thankful for this second chance at life. JP craves love and attention and will do well with someone who works from home often and has time to shower him with affection. He loves to go everywhere and now walks perfectly on the leash. At first, he had no idea what a leash was. And given his past bout with obesity, he loves food.

JP is fine with other other dogs (big and small) as well as cats. JP likes to sleep part of  the night on the bed and will sometimes jump off to lay down on the floor beside the bed. 

Given that we think JP spent years in a cage while eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom, his one downfall is that he is not housebroken. From time to time he will go on wee wee pads. His foster mom has tried very hard to housebreak him but he has not gotten it down yet. So a home with a yard where JP can learn that the grass is his safe place, would be ideal for him. 

JP is up-to-date on shots, neutered and microchipped. To meet him please go to our website and fill out an application: www.beastlyrescue.org/application",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43523013/1/?bust=1544634392 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43523013/2/?bust=1544634399 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43523013/3/?bust=1544634403 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43523013/4/?bust=1544634406 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43523013/5/?bust=1544634411 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43523013/6/?bust=1544634415,JP,43523013,M,S,A

Ziva is available for adoption. She is 8 years old and weighs 14 lbs. Her adoption fee is $400.00 Ziva is so sweet. She is definitely an alpha female. Ziva has great energy and appears much younger than her 8 yrs. She was cared for very well and is in excellent health. Although she gets along with other dogs she did have a few times that she wants the others to know who is in charge. I would suggest that Ziva would be the only dog in the family. We are working on her potty training and she doesnât use the puppy pads. She will need a family with a backyard that she can be let out to take care of business. Ziva walks great on the leash and it appears that her walks where for exercise. She loves walks! Enjoys car rides. Was very good in the bath and at the groomer. She eats very well and does not have any food aggression. Ziva is a love bug. She loves to cuddle and gives lots of kisses.

1422,Young,Beagle,"Before you ask about Vinny please read the full description.  Vinny is NOT your typical easy  going sweet beagle.  I know the photo is misleading however he can be quite the charmer with MEN.  Vinny is a self-conscious type of dog and is very suspicious of human motives when approached.  We attribute this to unpleasant early life experiences.  Vinny will do well in a home with just one man or a couple with dog experience.  Although good a on leash we just don't trust his behavior if a child were to run up to him or a person wanting to prove all dogs love them bends over his head.  He'd be OK in a  fenced yard and walks taken where there is limited exposure to encountering others.  Nose to the ground in the country he's probably a great candidate as a hunting dog.  He's more of that type of beagle than a docile house pet.    His guesstimated age is about three years of age and he was rescued from a Newark, NJ shelter. He weighs in the range of 25 pounds.   He enthusiastically runs to you when called,  sits politely for food, guarding a bone is another matter so no long lasting treats for Vinny.  He goes to his bed/crate when asked,  He opts to hide under a flannel blanket curled up so tight that you don't even know he's inside the blanket so of course he feels a little vulnerable when you wake him. He's a late sleeper and he grumbles when he doesn't want to get up but we all know someone like this! He's a very clean dog too that takes his business outdoors. Vinny likes car rides.   He's is OK with cats and great with other usually bigger dogs. Bottom line if you're a single male in a more suburban or country location, don't have kids; like to hike for long periods of time Vinny could really make a turn around  in his behavior.  I believe the key to his success is sufficient exercise to relieve his tension coupled with a protocol for rehabilitating his unwanted quirks.

1424,Young,"Beagle, Hound","Please note that Turbo has a special need for a daily RX injection described above.  An adopter must be able to administer a daily injection so that Turbo can control his water intake and allow for normal urine concentration.

Turbo celebrated is one year birthday in May of this year.  He's 35 pounds of gentle, loving kindness.  His mother is a small tri-color beagle from whom he inherited his sweetness.  He's fond of people of all ages, other animals, and has a consistent, reliable, trustworthy temperament. Turbo would make an amazing family dog with kids that are old enough to show respect for the family dog.  He'd also be well suited as a companion to a special needs child.

1425,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, Hound","This 60 pound hound mix called Blue is an athletic sports enthusiast with a love of outdoor life and the promise of adventure it holds.  Do you jog, have a pool or camp/hike near mountain streams?  Have you been thinking you'd feel safer with a companion that can athletically keep up with your pace and a size and overall appearance that would make someone with questionable intentions think twice on a trail or overnight camping?  

Spirit, speed and protection are the descriptive qualities I'd assign to Blue.  Best suited to a stable, energetic lifestyle dynamic - truck or jeep a plus!  

Blue is between 3-4 years - maybe a little younger.  He's been brought up to date with PROFESSIONAL basic training, good manners, leash walking and learning what it means to be a good dog and family member.  

He's spent several weeks this summer perfecting his muscle tone by diving and swimming in the pool.  We play a game called RESCUE - I toss the decoy, he dives and brings it to shore with me attached to his life vest. 

He's smart.  He can look you right in the eye when you say LOOK and point at your eyes (my favorite).  He works hard for food.  Gets along with other friendly dogs.  He can get some impressive lift off those four paws - a huge plus for a serious Frisbee tosser.  

 Blue needs TRUSTWORTHY stable leadership and structure.  We've built the foundation for him and he's ready for the next rung on the ladder.  Call Aunt Mary 908-362-1333  or e:mail auntmarysdoghouse@yahoo.com if you think Blue could be a great fit to your active life style.

1437,Senior,Spaniel,"Negrita came to the United States with her owner from Uruguay. Her owner was elderly when he relocated to City Island, NY to live with his daughter a few years ago, but he brought his beloved companion Negrita with him. He had rescued her years before when she was just a puppy and took excellent care of her throughout her life. 

Negrita's owner passed away in October 2018 and now Negrita is living alone in their little cottage while she searches for a new companion to love and keep company.

Negrita is approximately 9 years old (as of 12/2018). She gets along with 3 other dogs of varying sizes who also live on the property, but her true motivation in life is to be someone's best friend and constant companion.

Negrita was devoted to her previous owner until the ambulance took him away to hospice care. She is still young - she loves to go for walks, but she's also perfectly comfortable sleeping next to you in her little bed.

Negrita is a perfect size - approximately 25 lbs. She is gentle, both in the way she takes treats and in how she receives and gives affection.

The truth is, black dogs are constantly overlooked in shelters, even when they have the best personalities. Please don't overlook Negrita because of the color of her fur.

She deserves better!  She deserves to be loved and in return she will love you right back.

Negrita is waiting.  She is currently living in City Island, NY.

1456,Adult,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Hound","Here is what one volunteer has to say about Knox. A really lovely six year old dog 

Knox is a GREAT dog. I have to admit that the first time I met him, I took one look at him in the cage & thought he was going to be too strong for me to handle so I walked him LAST, in hopes of some other stronger volunteer to walk him but since nobody did, I took him out and I was overjoyed how EASY he was to walk !!! Knox was such a gentleman!!! There were other volunteers out with dogs that were barking at Knox, but Knox just smiled at them & went on his business & even wamted to still try to touch noses with the other dog through the fence.

1458,Young,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Terrier","Little Riley is two and a half years old and a little pocket Pittie about 35-38 lbs. she came here several months ago from an abusive situation and it took her a few months to decompress...luckily, she suffered no physical injuries,however, she was very reactive to other dogs as well as some people...Riley has come a long way and is ready for her forever home now. 
While she would probably do best as the only pet she is now,much less reactive and can be in the vicinity of other dogs without having any problems at all. Sheâs a smart little girl and learns quickly...Riley is now friendly with everyone and loves attention and affection.

Here is what a volunteer who spends a lot of time with her has to say 
âOf all the dogs in the shelter, the one I feel most sorry for is Little Riley. Riley came from a physically abusive home and what made me sad was when she came in, she seemed so happy to be at the shelter.  She was in a small cage and we went to meet her, her tail was wagging so fast. This dog, who was treated so badly was so trusting and came out of her cage, even trying to lick someone's face. She is very energetic, but once she runs around the yard a few times, she will come over to you for affection. Riley is very sweet. She has beautiful light brown eyes and she stares right in to your eyes as if she is trying to connect with you. I always talk to her because I get the feeling she understands. She has a sadness about her, but at the same time she comes across as such a resilient dog that is ready to move on and grateful for whenever someone takes her out. She listens when called & knows that when playtime is over, it's time to go back in her cage. Although she doesn't seem to like the other dogs, she did like one dog (a low key male dog who got adopted) and would enjoy running back and forth with him, even touching noses through the fence. Riley is a young dog with an old soul. She has been through a lot and deserves a second chance. Pls consider.â",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41678413/1/?bust=1526813091 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41678413/2/?bust=1534595201 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41678413/3/?bust=1534595951 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41678413/4/?bust=1534595952 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41678413/5/?bust=1532046790,Riley,41678413,F,M,A
1459,Young,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Mixed Breed","This what one volunteer told us about Jasper


Jasper Is a goofball dog- silly, happy, carefree, clueless that he is a big dog but sometimes thinks he is a LAP DOG (ha ha). Once in a while, he will sit his big butt on my lap & I tell him ""what do you think you're doing"" & his tail will start going fast & have a big silly grin on his face. He can be very affectionate & will lean on your legs so you can scratch his side (he seems to like that spot). He is high energy so will need someone who can give him lots if exercise. He loves toys more than anything & can keep himself entertained by tossing it up in the air then catching it. Although Jasper is one if the most cheerful dogs at the shelter, I do notice once in a while when I pass his cage that he seems lonely & let down. He is always standing at the front of his cage waiting so anxiously for someone to notice. I feel very sorry for him because I know he wants a person to call his own & he has been waiting a long time. Pls consider Jasper.

 Love this guy! Skipper is super smart and loves human affection. I walk him every weekend and we have a routine. He runs around in the outdoor pen for exercise. As soon as he sees a tennis ball that's his focus. He throws it around and plays with it. If he sees a 2nd tennis ball then he wants both. He tries to fit both in his mouth but that doesn't work. Then he picks one but drops it and goes back to the first ball. He does this a few times until he makes up his mind. I love watching him..He's so adorable. He has a lot of personality. He's young and energetic and needs regular exercise which is not possible living in the shelter.

Itâs his favorite thing to do in the entire universe.  If he canât play fetch, heâll challenge himself to pick up as many tennis balls as he can.  Weâve seen him fit 3 in his mouth at once!  Cola is smart as a whip and has learned how to sit and wait patiently until his volunteer friend throws his ball.  Heâs also fast as the wind.  Heâs back and drops it at your feet before you know it.  After a good game, Cola loves to lie down next to his volunteer and chill. 
Shelter life is hard for an active boy like Cola.  He gets out for about 20 minutes most days , The rest of his time is spent in his run where he waits for his next brief chance of freedom.  Cola would thrive in an environment with an active family or person.  A fenced in yard would be perfect, so he can get his daily exercise.  Kids 12 and up as his size and athleticism would not be ideal around younger children.

Cola will be a fairly low maintenance dog for the person who adopts him. He never seems to bark, he only jumps if you come to his kennel with a leash in hand. He never even react s to his neighbors antics and he takes treats gently. 
At this time, weâve labeled Cola as an only pet, but that could change once heâs out of the stressful shelter environment.  Cola is about 4 years old and 82 pounds.please contact our adoption coordinator, at 201- 981-3215 or email her at

1479,Young,Jindo,"??? Meet the beautiful Miss Zena ???

Zena is a one and a half year old Jindo,she resembles a shepherd or a Husky, but she is a Jindo or perhaps a Jindo mix. 
She weighs around 45 lbs and she wound up at the shelter when her former owners had problems that had nothing to do with Zena, but sheâs the one who wound up homeless...
She does not seem to have a problem around the other dogs. 
Jindos are very independent dogs. They donât come up and give you a kiss or try to jump in your lap. They enjoy their own company but once they bond with a person they are very loyal to that person...
If you are interested in Zena and have experience with the breed or a related breed,please contact us at 201-981-3215 and we will send you an application. You must submit your application prior to meeting Zena
She is very shy and was very frightened when she first arrived so you might even have to meet this pretty girl more than once. 
You can also request an application at lesliem147@gmail.com",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42665283/1/?bust=1536056087 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42665283/2/?bust=1536056090 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42665283/3/?bust=1536056092 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42665283/4/?bust=1536056811,Zena,42665283,F,M,A

I walked him yesterday and took him in one of pens where he can run around off leash.  Can this boy run!  Its sad to see such a young energetic dog sitting in a cage all day when it's cold outside.  He is very well behaved and so smart.  He sits for treats and yes he is super treat motivated.  He definitely acts like a puppy.  He is very loving and affectionate.  He is super friendly to all people.  Chase would make a wonderful addition to any family.

He has very long legs and loves to go on walks around the property. 
This boy is always hungry and heâs being fed extra meals to fatten him up a bit.

Ruby has a gentle temperment, friendly with everyone, easy to walk, well behaved and housetrained (I walk her first because she holds it until she is out of her cage). A very sweet dog, who waits so patiently at the shelter--I don't think I have ever heard her bark for attention, but when someone passes her run, she gets up from her bed to eagerly see if someone will notice her. I feel so sad for her and hope she can get out sooner than later. Although she is a senior, she runs around the yard as though she was a much younger dog.

1485,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Titan is a big boy with an even bigger heart who is bound to make the biggest mark on YOURS. 3 years old and full of spunk, this goofy guy is in search of a new hooman to love after his owner moved away, unable to take Titan along. 

Since his arrival at MVAS, Titan has discovered this fantastic thing called âtrainingâ. He enjoys sessions almost as much as the treats that come with them! Heâll even bust out a random âsitâ on walks, in case there is a spare treat in your pocket ?. Walks are also pure bliss for Titan, who is often thanking volunteers with a head turn mid floppy-eared prance. 

Other than YOU, Titanâs prized possession is his tennis ball, which he is happy to share. That goes for the couch, too.. as long as you donât mind pibble snores ?. 

A volunteer took Titan home for a pawjama party and they had a ball. She reports that he is special in more ways than one, 

âTitanâs loyalty, humor & clumsy romp make him one of a kind. He may be missing a few back toes yet he is the perfect balance of dog. Heâs like when playful meets cuddle monster. No accidents but lots of laughs. He would undoubtedly make your home complete.â 

Titan is afraid of kitties and dog selective, so he would prefer to be the only four legged member of your family. Donât pass up this op-paw-rtunity. Come meet Titan today!

1486,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Let's face it, if you were to look up ""doofus"" in the dictionary, Goober's picture would be alongside it. No, really... but he's an intelligent doofus. He takes training very seriously and it's seriously hysterical. Goober has perfected sit, down, and is able to play tug like a gentleman. He's obsessed with our new enrichment program because of all of the delicious peanut butter involved. 

This 1-2 year old Pit/Dane mix is a handful of fun, just like his namesake. He is also just as yummy (: Goober is dog & cat friendly. Meet & greet is required to ensure that he is the perfect fit for his fur siblings. 

If playful with a generous dash of droopy, sprinkled with a lot of laughs is your favorite recipe, Goober is the dog for you. Come meet him any day from 11-2 as this goofy guy is ready to be the comedian of your household that you couldn't picture life without.

I was surrendered by my owner due to NO TIME and since I'm a youngster I have energy and do need daily structured exercise and interactivity. I know basic commands and am housebroken;  but I'm very strong and could use some leash and manners training. I'm a sweet lovebug and I'm ok with dogs in passing but since I've been in foster care with no other dogs, I have become a bit isolated and need further socialization with other dogs. I was ok with a cat until the cat went after me and now I'm a bit wary of cats but with a nice mellow cat I think I could learn to coexist with one. Since I'm strong and wiggly happy, it's best if I go with older kids ages 10yrs+. I need someone who is experienced with my breed and is active and wants a dog to be active with. I would love a big fenced in yard to play fetch in as well. I'm a DIAMOND in the RUFF and need that special someone/family to polish me up!! cuz I'm a GEM of A DOG and will be your loyal companion and BFF! Please come meet/adopt me today!!

Marla is a 1.5 year old pit mix looking for her forever home. She is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. Her foster saved her from a bad situation. When she was picked up, she had just been attacked by other dogs she was living with, had large gaping wounds and it looked like she might have had puppies recently. The vet said Marla had visible scars and this wasn't the first time she had been attacked and it was possible she had just had puppies. As sad as Marla's past is, she doesn't let it get her down!  Marla is housebroken, crate trained, sweet and absolutely loves snuggling. She is great with other dogs (she is currently living with another dog in her foster home). It is unknown how she would do with cats as her foster family doesn't have any. Marla does get a bit excited when first meeting new people and will jump, but her foster family is working on that with positive reinforcement training. Because she's a bit jumpy it would be best if she went with older kids ages 10 yrs+.  She has come such a long way since she has been living in her foster home and would do best with a  family that is active and will continue the training started by her foster family. Ideally, her forever home would have a fenced in backyard for her to run around in. Marla is one sweet bunny of a dog and will be your BFF!! Come meet/adopt her today!!

1495,Adult,Shih Tzu,"What a cutie!  We're guessing Trixie is a Shih Tzu Mix.  Saying she's a small dog would be an understatement.  She weighs only 9.5 lbs.  She's sweet and loves being with people.  In the cage she barks begging us to take her. She loves attention and there's not a peep out of her when she's with a person.  We can understand.  The animal shelter can be a scarey place for a tiny little dog that is use to being with her person.  She's extremely affectionate, likes sitting on your lap and would be the perfect companion for someone home alone all day. 

Trixie has been to the vet.  Her Heartworm and Lyme disease tests were negative.  Fecal/Giardia tests were also negative.  She was given her Distemper and Rabies Vaccinations, bathed and groomed (to make her beautiful again).  Now she's ready for a new home.

The mix that keeps going around is shepherd/terrier/retriever.... but this is a medium size dog (nowhere near shepherd or retriever size) with short fur.  Found the day after the July 4th fireworks we were sure someone would be looking.  So many dogs are frightened by the loud noise, and they bolt.  That means this handsome gent could be from anywhere.  We waited and waited, but no one came.  No one called.   Since kids can be very noisy and he was so very scared when he came in we're thinking an adult household might be best.

happily she made her way to us and we are just thrilled to help get her back to just being a happy healthy pup.  She is still very wary of being touched but will seek out attention when she feels comfortable.  We have been using positive reinforcement techniques to build her trust of humans but she still has a long way to go.  
Connie is wee wee pad trained, up to date with vaccines and will be spayed with a dental cleaning as soon as the vet says she up to it.  We are battling a few health issues but most likely they are from years of poor care so they are resolving over time and lots of TLC.  
What kind of home does our little girl need?  One with lots of love patience and understanding.  She needs to feel secure that no one will hurt her and will just let her come around at her own pace.  We're not sure if she will ever be a snuggle bug but we have seen a little sparkle in her eyes when she allows us to pet her so we are hopeful that she will learn that love is unconditional.  We know she's not the average pup that will fit into any home but we are hoping that her special place is out there waiting to give her a forever family.

1499,Adult,"Mastiff, Mixed Breed","Hooch has the most gentle spirit. He's very friendly,  walks great on a leash and is house-broken. Once you give this big fella a treat or two ... you then know you have won him over. Hooch will be extremely loyal to who ever adopts him. He's a gentle giant that just wants to be loved.  He is great with most other dogs. Hooch is also great with kids and women; but he needs a slow introduction to men because we feel he had been abused my them in the past. 

Hooch has been waiting patiently for over a year to find a home he can call his own! He is currently approximately 4 years old (as of May 2018).

Please note: A home with a fenced-in backyard is a must.

Please check our website for more information about our adoption process.

 Summertime is the perfect time to adopt!

1511,Adult,"Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Pit Bull Terrier","My name is WASABI and I'm a handsome 3 year old male blue American Staffordshire Terrier (Amstaff). I'm medium sized at approx 60 lbs of swoon-worthy hunk! I am low - medium energy, am a rockstar at the dog park and enjoy kongs filled with cheese. I love all people but sometimes forget my manners and want to stand on 2 legs to hug, so it is best that I am in a home with kids at least 8 years old because I don't realize my size. I am very loyal, sweet and oh so handsome (pictures do not do me justice). I am housebroken, crate trained and have very good indoor manners, including never going on furniture. I pull a bit on the leash and would benefit from leash training or a no-pull harness. I am a bit of a floor-dwelling couch potato and my favorite pastime is laying on the floor by my owner's feet and watching tv, so I would make a fantastic Netflix marathon or all day Sunday football buddy. Like all dogs, I do need exercise but I tire quickly, so my exercise needs can be easily managed. Come meet me today so we can become best friends.

Scroll down to see more pictures of this dog.

Kramer is available for adoption.

He is 10 years old and weighs 17 lbs.

His adoption fee is $350.00.

Kramer, mild mannered, a real super hero is still looking for his forever home! He is a great dog - well behaved, sweet, house trained (this will change a bit until he gets use to a new house)! He loves running in the back yard and going out for walks. A fenced yard for him to explore would be a plus. Having someone around most of the time is important. He loves people. He would not be happy being left all day - he loves his foster Mom being around. He doesnât necessarily need other dogs but he does need his human around. Please consider this love bug for a place in your home.

1513,Young,Catahoula Leopard Dog,"Key, the one year old Catahoula Leopard Dog, is still waiting for his Forever Home. In addition to being gorgeous, he is also sweet, social, happy, goofy, intelligent, well-mannered... and deaf. His deafness hasn't slowed him down or held him back one bit. With the exception of using hand signals instead of voice commands, we treat this boy just like every other dog we've ever had, and he goes with the flow no matter where we are or what we're doing. He is housebroken, crate trained, walks nicely on leash with a harness, loves people of ALL ages, and dogs of ALL sizes. I would even feel comfortable saying he would be fine with dog-savvy cats after proper intros, as he's successfully met and interacted with several. He is medium energy, equally happy chasing a ball around the yard, going for a jog, sleeping in on a Saturday, or binge watching Netflix on the couch with you. This pup's sole wish in life is to be your best friend, your constant companion, your snuggle buddy, your adventure partner, your welcome committee, your everything.

""Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.""  - Mark Twain

If you think you are a good match for me, FIRST fill out an adoption application here: https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/
Our Website www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the adoption process. If you still have questions, you can reach out to my matchmaker: corey@bigfluffydogs.com.

NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION DUE TO THE SHEER NUMBER WE GET DAILY. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE MIGHT NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. 

* BEHAVIOR DISCLAIMER: We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. All dogs will require supervision with children, other dogs, and cats/other animals regardless of whether or not we have stated that the dog is friendly towards kids, cats, other dogs, etc. Slow introductions to other animals in the home, and allowing for them to have a separate space will make for better relationships in the future. Most dogs need an adjustment period when transitioning into a new home and there may be potty accidents, even if we have stated the dog is housebroken. All dogs should be somehow confined separately (crate or separate room) when left home alone until you can be sure the dog is trustworthy left loose. Separation anxiety can manifest if a dog is left alone more than it is used to in it's new home. This can be worked through and we are here to help. Please do not give up on your new dog without reaching out to us first!

* PUPPY DISCLAIMER: Adopters considering a puppy must be prepared for:
1. Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only ""hold it"" for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break).
2. Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.
3. Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences a puppy has the better, both in and out of your home.
4. Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well adjusted dog. 

Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/1/?bust=1536073318 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/2/?bust=1536073319 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/3/?bust=1544994946 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/4/?bust=1529454115 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41950924/5/?bust=1536073320,Key,41950924,M,L,A
1514,Adult,"Boxer, Great Pyrenees","This is Buffett, a 5 year old 1/2 boxer/ 1/2 Great Pyrenees clocking in at 80 pounds. He pretty much has a Boxer personality, and is goofy and silly.

Buffett is a very good boy. He is good with people, and will enjoy a home with kids older than 10.  This handsome boy has impeccable house manners, and we know he  came to us from a place where he was well-cared for and he has been a happy house pet for some time.

These are Buffett's needs:

1. People who get boxers. Boxers are dorks. He just happens to be 1/2 Great Pyrenees which mellows out the boxer some.
2. A fenced yard to play in or someone who will give him the exercise he needs.
3. Dog friends are cool. Unless they jump on his head.  Despite being a bit of a dork, the Pyr in this boy shines true here.  He will do best with other non-bouncy dogs.
4. Like most Boxers, Buffett thinks cats are for chasing.. Kind of like squirrels and small woodland creatures.  Buffett can live with cats, but only dog savvy ones. 
5. Snacks. This dog is food-motivated and will do just about anything for a cookie.
7. An extra plus couch of a super comfy dog bed. He's kind of the princess and he would definitely notice a lentil under 10 layers of mattresses.

Just like his namesake, all he wants to do is drink margaritas and eat cheeseburgers in paradise.

* BEHAVIOR DISCLAIMER: We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. All dogs will require supervision with children, other dogs, and cats/other animals regardless of whether or not we have stated that the dog is friendly towards kids, cats, other dogs, etc. Slow introductions to other animals in the home, and allowing for them to have a separate space will make for better relationships in the future. Most dogs need an adjustment period when transitioning into a new home and there may be potty accidents, even if we have stated the dog is housebroken. All dogs should be somehow confined separately (crate or separate room) when left home alone until you can be sure the dog is trustworthy left loose. Separation anxiety can manifest if a dog is left alone more than it is used to in it's new home. This can be worked through and we are here to help. Please do not give up on your new dog without reaching out to us first!

1515,Adult,Boxer,"Meet Brantley.  This adorable Boxer mix came to rescue from a very rural shelter in Alabama.  He's such a love bug, we have no idea why anyone would not want him in their home.

Brantley is great with other dogs.  He loves them and loves to play with them.  He's super sweet and super goofy, loves to romp and play, and loves to chill on the sofa.  Brantley has been fine with the cats he has met.  We have not had him around children, but think he'd be a great fit for homes with kids over 8 years of age. 

Most of all, Brantley loves his humans. He loves to romp in the yard with them, go on walks with them, and mostly just hang out with them.  He is a lover of all that is fine in life.  Food, walks, squeaky toys, and belly rubs.

If you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at http: https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/, then email Jolie@bigfluffydogs.com for more information on him.

All known information about an individual dog is provided in it's listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive. All Dogs Require:Supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43624945/1/?bust=1545782635 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43624945/2/?bust=1545782639 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43624945/3/?bust=1545782641 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43624945/4/?bust=1545782644,Brantley,43624945,M,M,A

1528,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"The following is the assessment from the foster parent:

I am looking down at this gorgeous black and white female pit mix curled up at my feet.  She has such incredibly expressive eyes that watch you intently as you go about your day.  She is about 9 months old so she has a bit of puppy play in her but it is nothing unmanageable.   

Chika and I have spent our days both on strenuous hikes and on the couch.  I am convinced she would be happy to walk across the surface of the sun as long as it was with her people.   In all seriousness she is up for anything or nothing, it is completely up to you.

Chika walks great on the leash and gets along grandly with dogs and cats.  She sleeps quietly in her kennel  but does best when that kennel is close to her people.

There are a few things potential adopters should know and be prepared for.   Chika is nervous at first when meeting people she does not know, so gradual and thoughtful introductions need to take place.  I have found that a slice of cheese is a quick way to her heart though and will put you at the top of her favorite person list!

Lastly Chika doesn't like to see her people go and, while she has gotten better, she will bark for you after you leave.  For this reason adopters with either their own house or an understanding landlord might be a better fit.   

Above all else in the short time we have had her she has made tremendous progress on all these fronts.   Remember she is young and with a properly structured environment will likely outgrow her anxieties.

This cuddle bug has truly captured our hearts and we cannot wait to arrange an introduction.

Louie is 6-7 years old and has a big heart in a compact body.  In addition to the surgery on his leg, he also had his vaccines and has been neutered.  Louie will be microchipped prior to adoption.

Funny how a perfect stranger has more compassion then the family.  Mia is older, 11 years old and just wants a quiet place to live out her days.  While she is tolerant of the other dogs in her temp home, it is obvious that she would prefer a less busy place to call her own.  She is a loving lady and doesn't ask for much.  She can usually be seen off in a corner resting or hanging out in a patch of sun in the yard.  Mia came in a bit overweight but her foster mom has her on a diet and getting more exercise.  Soon she will be looking fit and trim.  Her bloodwork showed a healthy dog for her age.  She is fully vetted.  Personally I love the seniors and would take a 10 year old over a 10 week old any day.  Take a chance with Mia.  She has a heart full of love to share and only asks for some peace & quiet in return.

1540,Adult,"Terrier, Greyhound","Abbey is a gorgeous 5-year-old greyhound mix who came into her home at 5 months of age. She was raised with many dogs around, but as sheâs matured her desire to have other dogs around has diminished. We are trying to find Abbey a home where she will get undivided attention and have her humans to herself.  She is a bit aloof when meeting new people but as long as people let her get to know them on her terms she settles in nicely. Sheâs extremely loving with her people, enjoys snuggling and gives gentle kisses often, but doesnât do well with active or small children. She walks extremely well on a leash, and while she gets slightly reactive when she sees other dogs during walks, she can easily be re-directed with treats and praise. Abbey is an independent player, and if given a rope-toy or a bone sheâll play all by herself for quite some timeâ¦ for some reason she plays best with these items if a person she enjoys is watching her. She loves to run, and is extremely fast, so a fenced-in yard is necessary. Being a greyhound mix, she shouldnât be with any small animals (namely cats, rodents, etc.). Sheâs very vocal, and makes strange howling sounds, but when sheâs relaxed she doesnât make a peep. She does love her crate, and will settle into it nicely. Abbey is totally vetted and ready and waiting for a single pup home.

1541,Adult,"Chihuahua, Feist","THIS IS A COURTESY POST. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MEETING ANNIE, PLEASE CONTACT PEGGY OVER AT POUND DOG, FOUND DOG RESCUE LOCATED IN BARNEGAT, NJ. SHE CAN BE REACHED AT PDFDrescue@hotmail.com

Minnie is going to make someone very happy! 
This 7 year old sweetheart has a wonderful demeanor and is easygoing and low maintenance. She didnât have much going for herself -  black coat, nondescript older dog who found herself in a kill shelter. Despite that, she hasnât spent one minute feeling sorry for herself.  She thrives in foster care, simply loving life. Her favorite pastime - squirrel patrol and being your sofa companion. At 18 pounds sheâs a perfect small dog size and wonât take up much room in the bed! 
Minnie would love to be an only dog so she can lap up all the attention for herself. She loves people and makes herself comfortable with them. A fenced yard would be perfect for her - we want her to be able to explore her world in safe surroundings. 
Minnie is house trained and crate trained, spayed and up to date with vaccinations. And she has just had a dental cleaning to show off her beautiful smile! Did we say she loves to take walks?  Do you? 
We love rescuing dogs like Minnie. Black dogs are so often overlooked in shelters, and 7 year olds are sometimes thought of as too old. Minnieâs only giveaway is her grey muzzle but she shows no signs of slowing down. She has years of love and companionship to give and sheâs waiting for a family to call her own. 
Please consider opening your heart to an older dog!

1542,Young,"Beagle, English Bulldog","Tinker  is a 3 year old female Bulldog/Beagle/ mix.  Sweet affectionate cuddly. Bomb proof with children of all ages. Raised with kids n toddlers. Crate tolerant. Likes to learn, tries to please and is very food motivated. Willing to try new things. Good at dog parks,  always willing to play. Great with other dogs, she really enjoys rough-housing with the resident dogs and she is very good at it. Tink would be a great play-mate for another good-natured pup. She is also OK with cats. Chews hard n fast on harness, leads n long lines.  So best not to be left alone with little supervision while outdoors. She has a lean, muscular body that enables her to clear a 4 ft fence. Altho, I have to say that I have a 6 foot vinyl fence and so far she has made no attempt to make a break for it. I suppose the 4 foot chain link in her previous foster home was just too tempting.  Best in a home where she would get some exercise to tire her out.. High energy for walking hiking jogging swimming agility and has a harness for cart pulling.
Tink is up to date with her shots (rabies & distemper/parvo, spayed and microchipped). She must be returned to the rescue if you are unable to keep her containrd.

1543,Senior,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Doberman Pinscher","Coco is a 9 year young angel who was pulled out of the Newark shelter to give her a second chance at love.  She was dumped because her family was supposedly moving but I don't know how anyone could give up a gem like her.  She hasn't stopped hugging me since I brought her home.  She is a bigger gal at 75 pounds and she does like to wrap her paws around you but she is very gentle.  Coco is housebroken and up to date with her vaccines.   She does have some scars on her elbows from sitting on the cold cement in the city pound but she is well on her way to being healed.  A big cushy dog bed helps.  Coco does well with the other foster dogs.  She even deals well with the freshie brat pooch who thinks he rules the roost.  In fact, I use her to test out the new arrivals because the first thing she does is go into a 'play bow' stance when meeting a new pup to attempt to get them to chase her.  She holds her own wrestling with the younger set.  However, she does have a high prey drive and is not a good choice for a home with kitties or very small dogs (but she is getting better with the pups).  While  Coco is up there in age, she still has a spring in her step.  She enjoys wslks and loves her car rides.  She is reserved and quiet and likes nothing more than to curl up next to you for some pets and snuggles. 
This pup is a total love.  Please don't write off a senior dog.  They are so appreciative for being taken into a loving home.   I always say, I would take a 10 year old over a 10 week old any day.  And Coco is a perfect example of why.

1547,Baby,"Boxer, Pit Bull Terrier","LEAH HAS A PENDING ADOPTION AND IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

Leah is a 7 month old Pittie pup (as of mid Dec 2018) who was tossed away by a backyard breeder.  She was left in a yard to starve and die.  Living the life she's had so far, she is a little toughie.  She needs an experienced home who will take the time to train her properly.  The one thing we as rescuers hate is someone adopting a cute, cuddly puppy and returning them years later as an unruly adult.  She can be very snuggly and affectionate with humans but she is very bossy with other dogs.  While she is young enough to be turned around at this point but no novice Pit owners please. 
She is now spayed, up to date with her shots, dewormed and microchipped.  Leah is an active pup so if you are looking for more of a couch potato, she's not your gal.  If you think you have the fortitude to tame the wild beast (kidding) please send in an application for Leah.  Seriously, with proper guidance and supervision, she will be a great dog.

Meet Apollo!!!!  Apollo was pulled from a local shelter.  He was abandoned in a car lot with a bunch of other dogs.  Apollo has been in daily training for the past 6 months, and is doing great. Apollo knows sit, stay, lie down, fetch, and paw. He is a big, strong, and athletic boy who just wants to please and needs lots of exercise!  Apollo is a teddy bear who is great with strangers and friendly to people he meets.  Apollo walks in a heel on leash and does not pull. However, Apollo does NOT like other dogs and while he does not lunge or pull toward other dogs, he does need to keep a clear distance. Apollo would do best with a fenced in yard, but he will stay on your property if supervised off-leash. Apollo does not like thunderstorms or fireworks, but is fine if provided a quiet and safe space. Want to hit the beach? Apollo LOVES the water and will play fetch and swim. Apollo loves rides in the car, and is a good passenger, laying down in the back seat. Apollo is a gentleman when playing or taking treats, he is obedient, loyal, and very affectionate. If you are looking for a BFF to go everywhere with you, and be your companion on your adventures, please consider Apollo. He is the dog you will remember for a lifetime!  Prior GSD experience is highly recommended for this awesome dog. 

For more information about our adoption policies and to access our online application, please visit our website at www.gsgsr.org.  Please note:

GSGSR primary service area is New Jersey, Eastern PA, Delaware Valley and Manhattan.  We are not able to service Long Island at this time.  

The age requirement for adoption is 25 to 70 years old; If you are outside of this age range, please email us first.

We require all adopters attend professional training with their adopted dog.  Exceptions are made for adopters who are K-9 professionals or for senior dogs being adopted.

We are an all volunteer organization and every effort is made to proceed as efficiently as possible with an application. As with all rescues, we do require veterinary references if you have a pet, personal reference, a phone interview and home visit. This process has been created to insure that we match each applicant with the best possible dog.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/1/?bust=1534042833 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/2/?bust=1534042834 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/3/?bust=1534042835 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/4/?bust=1520145033 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/5/?bust=1534042835 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41098518/6/?bust=1520145232,Apollo,41098518,M,L,A
1588,Adult,"German Shepherd Dog, Akita","KUMA - Akita / German Shepherd Mix

5 years old â People friendly â Best as only dog in house â Dog friendly outside home

Kuma is a happy go lucky Akita/German Shepherd/Husky mix who loves to have fun, snuggles and long car rides. Once you become Kumaâs friend, you are friends for life. While Kuma has a lot of energy, he is also able and willing to lounge around with a best friend who lean up against you for affection. Kuma is house trained, walks well on a leash and knows basic commands. He will generally ignore larger dogs on a walk, but does like to chase small animals and is fascinated by birds. While Kuma is very friendly, he does have one bite history on him, so he will need to go to an experienced owner. He is fine in crowds and has been at dog adoption events meeting strangers with no issues. If you are looking for a nice big Akita mix who will be loyal and affectionate, check out Kuma.

He will make a great companion to a single owner, or a wonderful couple looking for a buddy to go on hikes or just chill out at night.  We estimate Kuma to be about 5 years old.

Please note:

Sedona Shepherd Sanctuary's mission is to rescue adult and senior German Shepherd and mixes and find them loving homes. All of our dogs are fully vetted, up to date on all their shots

Good With Dogs: Yes
Good With Cats: NO CATS
Good with Children: Yes

Beautiful, gentle on the eyes, the leash, and the soul, this 4 year old girl is looking for the loving home she has never known. Lucy was a breeder dog discarded in a high kill shelter, and she was so neglected that the tips of her soft ears are completely flea bitten. Lucy is also HW positive, and needs to be spayed after she completes her HW treatments. Lucy has already started her HW treatment at our veterinarian, and desperately needs a long term (few months) foster home that can see her through her medical treatments so she will be ready for adoption to her forever home.

Lucy is incredibly sweet with everyone she meets, she is non-reactive to any dog she meets or sees while on leash, and she is a delight to meander on a walk (due to her HW, she cannot go hiking or for very long walks yet). She is a dream passenger in the car and is good being crated as well. Can you find a spot in your home to help this GENTLE SOUL? Polite, house-trained, crate trained, good in the car, non-reactive to other dogs while on leash or in public, Lucy is a true lady.

1593,Adult,German Shepherd Dog,"Magnum â 7 year old Fun Loving German Shepherd

Magnum is a German Shepherd who is always in motion.  Not one to sit and pose for a picture, he likes to move around, greeting new people, checking out new scents, playing with toys, or just going for a nice long walk.  Magnum is a handsome boy and has some very distinguishing features, a soulful face, large classic German Shepherd ears, long legs and a nice soft coat.  Magnum is well socialized around people and is happy to make friends.  For part of his life, Magnum lived with a large Labrador, and is friendly to well mannered dogs, but not really interested in playing.  He prefers chasing to making friends with cats.

Magnum is in good health, and he maintains a lean body.  Magnum can be possessive over his toys, so he will need an experienced handler.  He would be best suited for a family with large dog experience.

1594,Adult,German Shepherd Dog,"Velvet And Callie Sisters Looking For A Home Together

Velvet and Callie are a pair of German Shepherd sisters rescued from a hoarder in New Jersey.  Today these friendly 4 year old sisters are ready to begin the best part of the rest of their lives; finding a loving home.  Velvetâs floppy ears give her a playful look, which perfectly matches her personality.  Velvet is inquisitive, friendly and is a happy go lucky girl.  Once she is comfortable with a new friend, she will come right up to you and give you a wet sloppy kiss.

Callie, her sister, is the more serious of the girls, and feels it is her place to look out for Velvet.  Although her demeanor is a bit more reserved than Velvet, Callie will warm up fairly quickly to new people and new surroundings.  Callie has the classic German Shepherd ears.  Like her sister she also likes to give a sweet kiss to her new friends.

Having lived most of their lives in crates and cramped conditions, Velvet and Callie just love now to go out and romp around a yard and play.  After a few minutes on a walk, they will settle down and walk fairly nicely, though a training lesson or two wouldnât hurt.  Velvet and Callie are moderate sized German Shepherds, around 60 pounds each.   They are in relatively good health, though both need to be spayed and Callie could use to put on a few pounds.  Otherwise they are up to date on all their vaccinations, and ready to go to their new home.

You can read about their story and the sad case of a lack of justice for the hoarder.  As of this time Sedona Shepherd has taken in four of the German Shepherds, including Wren and Kolby.   Since little money was recovered by the municipality, Sedona Shepherd (and all the rescues that have helped) have had to cover all of the medical costs for these dogs.  We estimate the veterinary care to cover all four of these beautiful dogs to be $2,500.  In addition to paying for all of their shots and check-up, Velvet and Callie need to be spayed.  Kolby needed surgeries for neutering and a hernia and is on medication to help manage his dry eye syndrome.  Please help us by donating to Velvet and Callieâs medical bills.

Sedona would also like to thank Terrie Carr and the Rock Nâ Ruff crew at WDHA for their feature of Velvet and Callie.

Adele is such a smart puppy!
Adele is originally from Shanghai, China. Adele was being trained for police work and she flunked out. Placed in a dog crate in the alley outside the police department she waited for days without food or water to be rescued! Fortunately Shanghai Animal Rescue heard about her plight and they found her, provided the care and safety Adele needed, until she left on her flight to the USA to her new adoptive family and arrived on July 4th.

But poor Adele, her new family loved her, but their cats did NOT ?  Adele enjoyed chasing the poor kitties, and unfortunately terrified them. A trainer was brought in, and Adele tried, but the kitties were just too tempting to chase, and the kitties got too traumatized, so Adeleâs family turned to GSGSR for help.  Adele has traveled halfway around the globe in search of her sanctuary, her forever home. Adele is still a puppy in body and spirit, she loves to play with other dogs, she is housebroken, loves her crate, walks well on a leash, enjoys riding in the car, and LOVES, LOVES to play ball!

Adele is the complete GSD package, beauty, brains, and FUN!
If you have the time and patience to complete training with Adele, you will have an amazing BFF!

1599,Adult,German Shepherd Dog,"SHELLIE - A Happy German Shepherd In Need of Healing and Love

Sweet Shellie was found wandering the streets of Philadelphia this past summer. Shellie is an easy going adult German Shepherd who loves to meet new people. With the help of Charwill German Shepherd Rescue, Sedona Shepherd was able to save Shellie from being euthanized when the shelter became over crowded. Once Shellie settled into our program it was obvious that she had medical issues that needed to be attended to. The biggest concern is the chronic ear infections in both ears.

Any owner of a dog that has dealt with chronic ear infections knows how difficult this issue can be to get under control, especially if the ear infections have been neglected for some time. With the help of Fanwood Vet and our volunteers, we put Shellie through a number of medications and daily flushing and cleaning of her ears with the hope of cleaning out the ear without the need for surgery.

While we have been able to stabilize the infections, Shellie continues to be very uncomfortable and the effectiveness of her treatments have plateaued. After consulting specialists at Crown Vet Hospital, it was agreed that the best course of action is for a total ear ablation surgery on one and possibly both ear canals. The surgery removes the ear canals and cleans out all the infection as well as the possibility of continued infection. Without this surgery, Shellieâs ear infections will not get better and she will remain constantly in a state of discomfort.

The cost of the surgery is approximately $3,500 and the recovery time is about two â three weeks before she will be able to be adopted. We have had success with this type of surgery in the past and we know that once it is completed that Shellie will truly be able to enjoy her life and look forward to finding her forever home.

UPDATE : DEC 6, 2018 - Shellie is recovering from her surgery. The recovery process will take a while and she is in some discomfort and pain. For now they will continue to have to drain her ears. We are also waiting on the results of bacteria culture taken during the surgery to make sure we know exactly which anti-biotics to be using and what are the best medications to help with the remaining ear, which we are hopeful can be saved.

UPDATE : DEC 9, 2018

Shellie is now home with her foster home recovering from the surgery. The vet removed all of her tubes, she still has a pain patch on her that wil be removed in the next couple of days. Shellie is feeling a lot better and getting spunky and ready for some exercise. She really loves being with her foster mom.

Sammy is an easy going and very friendly and gentle adult German Shepherd.  The past year has been tough on Sammy as his prior owner had life threatening medical issues that she needs to take care of, and was desperate to find a home for Sammy.  She reached out to Sedona and we took Sammy into our foster program.

Sammy just loves people, little ones, big ones, medium size ones.  He also loves to chase and play fetch or play with any toy around.  Sammy is a pretty easy going boy.  He walks well on a leash and all you need is to give him a gentle tug if he is pulling too much.

Sammy is trustworthy in a house and can just chill the day away with you or if you want, go out for a nice walk or hang out in the back yard with his family and a jolly ball.  Although Sammy spent some time with dogs when he was younger, he would do best in a home without other animals.

Both are housebroken and crate trained (they actually love sleeping in their crates) They are healthy, up to date on all vaccinations and altered.

Big Dog- She is great on a leash, and we think she would  be easy to train to do tricks.  This little smartie is motivated by yummy chicken and would enjoy the ""job"" of learning new things.

1633,Young,"Chow Chow, Golden Retriever","Meet Eli!!! Eli is a beautiful 2.5 year old male golden retriever mix. Eli is neutered, UTD on vaccines and ready for his furrever home. Eli does have some dysplasia in his hips- one hip has been replaced and the other has not but he is an active dog that plays and runs without issue. He is at this time on Cosequin supplements but has been fine on just the vitamin.
Eli was not treated well in his past and does have anxiety when first meeting a person. However, if the person approaches slowly in steps and gives him a treat, he quickly begins to trust. With people he knows, he is a Velcro dog- a total love bug that seeks and gives affection. Eli is good with neutral and submissive dogs. He does well inside and currently has a large fenced in area to run, but he does not like to be crated in small spaces as it triggers some latent anxiety. Due to his hip issues, Eli would do best in a low key household with adults and older children. A home without a lot of steps and a fenced yard would be perfect for Eli as he likes to run and chase his ball.
Eliâs trainer and his foster mom will meet with potential adopters to introduce Eli. Therefore, he needs a home within a 3 hour drive of Raleigh NC. Eli may require two or three visits to make sure he is completely comfortable with the adopter prior to taking him home. But Eli is a smart boy who adjusts quickly and wants nothing more to accompany his person on walks and sit with them on the couch. He is a very sweet boy who can catch treats and balls in the air!
If interested, please contact Toni Roman at Heart Rescue troman0218@hotmail.com. for applications. you could also email his foster mom Rachel at mysticwolf652002@yahoo.com for additional info on Eli.

Cupcakes for a dear friend's birthday, a holiday storefront window, even Tony the Tiger's signature flakes. Truly, they're grrreat.

And if the particular face belongs to 8 year-old Manchita? Well Christmas, it's come early. ""I love Manchita,"" I whispered to a staff member, but in reality, we hadn't even met. Just the sight of her in her kennel, those eyes, that hesitant smile, and, oh yes that frost. It yanked me right off the market. But the sight of this copper-colored cutie well it pales in comparison to her charms. Days later, once she'd found her footing and recognized well-meaning friends, we officially met and I officially fell. Chita is all there is. Now, 8 may technically qualify miss M for senior status, but don't go thinking lazy days are ahead. Just the sight of a ball is enough to start this dainty diva's toes to tapping, and if there's a happier sight than Chita gently munching her conquest post jubilant play, well reader, I haven't seen it. Chita can still be a bit shy initially with strangers, so would do best with an experienced family who'll take it slow (but be ready for play when she is). Cupcakes are great, but the sweetest treats, they last forever. Just like the love of Chita. Chita sits in boarding waiting for a foster family or adoptive family to come rescue her and give her the loving home she deserves! Thanks for caring about a pet in need! Manchita is up to date on shots, spayed and microchipped. If you would like to meet this wonderful girl, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414 or amsterdog@gmail.com.

She is fine walking by dogs in the street, never had an issue with that. She has not been around any young kids only my nieces. I think she will be fine but she is âpawsyâ when requesting pets.

We have a video camera and can hear whatâs going on. She is fine with strangers. She has shown some fear when meeting certain people and I realized that is when they stand over her and stare at her. But once they give her a pet sheâs their friend forever. She was outside when the mailman came and was fine and accepted pets from strangers in fire island. She was initially afraid of my dad, he gave her a treat and now they are best friends and he picks her up to go for rides.

Quick Introduction to Petunia

Iâm Petunia â an exuberant flower girl whoâs urgently searching for a foster home and also seeking a forever home. Deep inside, Iâm addicted to love, but I get uneasy when I first meet new people and dogs. Iâm just not the type of girl whoâll jump right into the arms of anyone. I need to take it slow, as I want to make sure these newbies are friendly before I pledge my love to them. I can get scared and bark at first, but weâve found that when yummy treats are part of the program, it makes the getting-to-know-you process smoother. So please be patient with me, and after a while, Iâll flop right on my back, begging ever so sweetly for my favorite thing of all â BELLY RUBS! A close-and-running second to belly rubs are KISSES. Note: Kisses wonât happen as quickly, but donât fret, once Iâve fallen for you, they are required (both giving and receiving) and will be part of the relationship. Abundance of energy, abundance of love, searching for my abundant life.

Petuniaâs Background

I had a family once, and they gave me up â brought me to an inner-city shelter when they found out they were having a baby. I was scared and nervous during this transition, yet remained a sweet girl. I started to bloom again when a volunteer from Rescue Haven Foundation saw my photo and story, and I was brought under the wings of their organization.

Living with Petunia

The recommendation is for me to be in a foster and/or forever home with a dog-savvy person or with someone who is excited to work with one of Rescue Havenâs awesome trainers â this way, my learning can be continued. We feel Iâd do well in home as the only dog. Iâll need regular exercise each day due to my high energy level so hopefully youâll be up for that.

Petuniaâs Forever Home

Have you heard the expression, âWork hard. Play hard.â? My twist on it is âWork hard. Play hard. Love hard.â And thatâs pretty self-explanatory. My foster family will need to continue my training so I can bloom into the bestest Petunia in the garden â thatâs our âworkâ. Weâll need daily âplayâ for exercise and stimulation. And for the greatest gift of all, âloveâ â ours will include belly rubs and kisses, for sure â Iâll just need you to be patient with me as I warm up to new things. If you want some flower power in your life, please fill out a foster application with Rescue Haven, and make a shout out that you âPick Petunia!â

House and crate trained
Walks well on a leash and is learning to make his walks even longer

Quick Introduction to Milton

Hi, Iâm Milton! Iâm super-small in size and extra-large in sweetness. The first thing I ask of you is to read my story from start to finish â promise you wonât stop in between or even at the next sentence. You see, Iâm blind, and you may not have any experience in having a blind dog. Itâs amazing what blind dogs are capable ofâ¦ it may be beyond your comprehension right now, but itâs not beyond mine, because I am living proof! In humans, vision is their most well-developed sense, but in dogs, smell is the primary sense. I can assure you that my smelling capabilities are at the top of the charts (especially when my kibble or treats are on the agenda!). Yes, there are precautions, commands, and adaptations that need to be made when you have a blind dog. And once you understand what they are, we get into our groove, and I learn the navigation of the house (my safe place) and our routine, there may be some moments Iâm getting around so well that you actually forget Iâm blind. With the set-up Iâm provided in my foster home, I navigate very well, and they continue to teach me commands to help me navigate even better. When none of the humans are home, I stay in a large pen or have free roam of a gated area with my doggie companions. Sometimes I hang out with the other doggies; other times I do my own thing, like nap in my bed with a cuddly blanket. When my humans are home, I love being near them â whether itâs staying close by while theyâre doing household things or lounging on the couch while they watch TV (and I make sure to listen, so I know whatâs happening on our favorite shows). Besides my lack of vision, Iâm a low-maintenance guy. I promise to love my forever person with all of my heart, and Iâm looking for that special someone to be completely open to my embrace.

âBetter to be blind and see with your heart, than to have two good eyes and see nothing.â

Miltonâs Background

I sadly ended up at an inner-city shelter and was at risk of being euthanized. One of Rescue Havenâs volunteers heard about my urgent situation and brought me to safety â right into the arms, heart and home of their rescue group. Iâm completely grateful and beyond happy to feel safe and loved by this wonderful group of people. I was underweight when I was first rescued, but with my good appetite, Iâm eating well, and all 7 pounds of me have filled out nicely (wink)!

Miltonâs Typical Day in Foster Home

Did you ever hear the expression, âitâs raining cats and dogsâ? Well in my foster home, itâs definitely raining dogs! There are three dogs who live there permanently, there are three other dogs (fosters like me) who live there temporarily, and there are two human parents. Now that I think about it, itâs kind of like a 2017 animal-friendly version of the Brady Bunch (groovy)! All of us wake up before sunrise to start our day. Weâre taken outside to do potty, and when back inside, we sit down as a family to eat breakfast (giggle)! Actually, we each have our own eating spotsâ¦ mine is in a large pen which gives me my own safe space to consume my food and nutrients (breakfast of champions). I continue to hang out in my pen while my foster mom gets ready for work. After she leaves, my foster dad, who works from home (A.K.A., heâs home all day), brings me into his studio, and I keep him company. We go out for walks to explore the neighborhood and get some exercise, and before you know it, itâs time to eat dinner and for my foster mom to come home. We go for one more walk at night before itâs time to lounge on the couch with my humans and canine companions. When bedtime comes upon us, I have my own cozy bed in my foster parentâs room. Their bedroom is on the second floor so they make sure to have a gate at the top of the stairs so Iâm safe and sound while we get a good nightâs rest. I typically sleep like an angel, and if I need them for some reason, they know Iâll give a little bark as my sign (woof).

Living with Milton

As mentioned above, I live with other dogs, and I get along well with them. Iâm just not very interactive with other canines, but itâs nice to know theyâre around. I enjoy doing my own thing â like napping on my bed with my blankie. A quiet home would be best as I can start to bark a bit if there is a lot of stimulus around me. We feel Iâd do fine either being the only dog in the house or having other small doggie companions (Iâd definitely smell them and most likely follow them around with my nose). Iâll need someone who will care for me regarding my blindness. You can check out this website which provides useful information regarding blind dogs. Itâs one of those things that you donât really think about until itâs right under your nose (an appropriate metaphor), but youâll see that doing specific things can help a dog like me easily became part of your forever family http://www.blinddogs.net/tips_help.html

Miltonâs Medical

Some people may call me âspecial needsâ â we just think Iâm âspecialâ! Iâm 13 years old and have hypothyroidism which is being regulated through medication. I get eye drops 2 times a day, and when it comes to taking my medication, itâs easy-peasy for both me and my human (good boy)!

âKindness is a language that the deaf can hear and the blind can see.â

Miltonâs Ideal Forever Home

Is your heart full of kindness for a doggie like me? Iâll be able to feel your kindness every moment of every day from deep within my soul. And I will give you all of my heart. All I want is a human who will love me, protect me, and care for meâ¦ so I can live the rest of my life safely, in my own little world, with you by my side.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42720258/1/?bust=1537585688 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42720258/2/?bust=1537585692 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42720258/3/?bust=1537585695,Milton ~ Small Wonder!,42720258,M,M,A

Sweetie pie, enjoys being held, sitting on your lap and playtime

Gets along fabulously with other dogs, especially loves his dear canine friend, Daisy

Crate trained; good doggie manners, walks well on a leash

Quick Introduction to Taco

Hola! Iâm Taco, and my name has a story behind it: I was rescued on National Taco Day, and for me, that was the best day ever! Also, did you know that the Chihuahua
is the smallest breed of dog and is named after a state in Mexico? Therefore, youâll hear me say some words in Spanish as I tell you about myself. I promise, none of these things Iâve just mentioned have a
nything to do with the Chihuahua who starred in the Taco Bell commercials â we are not related (although, I have to admit, he is quite as adorable as I am). Iâm an active, little tyke â who loves to play, give kisses, be held, and find a spot right on your lap when weâre taking a siesta together. My tail is always wagging in an effort to show you how happy I am. Iâm crate-trained, and it only takes me a few minutes to settle in before I sleep right through the night like an angel. I get along great with all the other dogs, and I have an extra-special BFF named Daisy, who is my canine sibling (we are not blood related, but we are siblings in all other ways, through and through). I have good house manners, have gone through obedience training, and have learned how to make my little legs strut my stuff while walking on a leash with the grace of a salsa dancer. Iâm the kind of doggie who aims to please, so I make it a point to excel in all these areas. Please read on so you can learn more about me â your potential muchachito!

Tacoâs Background

About a year ago, somehow I became a stray and was on the streets all alone. I ended up walking into a hair salon of all places at an attempt to get off the streets and find help. It was a great strategy because thatâs when Rescue Haven was contacted, and I soon became a foster dog in their rescue group. I was quickly adopted and was living in a home with another doggie named Daisy (sheâs my bestie who I told you about). We thought all was going well, until, unbeknownst to us, something happened to our family structure. Then to our surprise, Daisy and I were returned to Rescue Haven â due to no fault of our own, I will emphasize â which leaves us looking for a new family. And this time, we want to make sure that we find our true âforeverâ family. And mark my words, Iâll look forward to celebrating National Taco Day each year with my forever family as well tell each other âYo Quiero Muchoâ!

Tacoâs Forever Home

After reading this, Iâm sure youâre just as excited about National Taco Day as I am, since now you understand why thatâs such an important milestone in my life! Iâll be great company for many types of people and households. I can sit on your lap while weâre watching TV, give you kisses, wag my tail, and, without a doubt, go with you on walks as I show you my smooth salsa moves. And if you are ready for double the fun, you can adopt my bestie Daisy too, so we can stay together forever. Then we can play, play; love, love, rest, rest play, play, love, love, rest, rest, and repeat, repeat!

Please fill out an adoption application with Rescue Haven and make sure to tell themâ¦ Yo Quiero Taco! And donât forget about my BFF, Daisy! I love her mucho!

1650,Senior,Terrier,"Genesisâ Woof-Facts

Female, Affenpinscher-mix, 12 years old, 11 pounds

Sweet and gentle soul

Loves to be held, receive pets, and give kisses

House- and wee-wee pad trained; leashed trained

Gets along with other dogs but has no problem doing her own thing

Low activity level

Vision-impaired (due to cataracts) yet gets around just fine with a little guidance

Quick introduction to Genesis

Hello, Iâm Genesis. My humans brings light to my day, and I make sure to âgreetâ my foster mom whenever she enters the room. You know, we chit-chat a bit (doggie-talk), and then I tag along with her around the house and keep her company. When Iâve had enough excitement for the moment, I enjoy settling into my cozy bed and taking a comforting nap. I take multiple naps a day actually, so my nickname is not only Genie, but Iâm also referred to as Sleeping Beauty. Youâll notice that my hair has a bit of that scruffy-styleâ¦ I say itâs my alter ego showing off my wild-side (wink)! Oh, I love to eat my meals, with cheese happening to be my favorite treat. âSay cheeseâ and Iâm all yours!

Genesisâ Background

Who knows how, but I ended up as a stray dog in NYC. Can you imagine, little me, found wandering around a city park all alone? Someone found me and brought me to a large city shelter. My light of hope came when Rescue Haven Foundation arrived at the shelter to take me under their wing. And my new beginning commenced.

Genesisâ Typical Day in Foster Home

We are early risers in my foster home. I have multiple canine foster siblings who wake up at 5:30 a.m., so Iâm up too and ready to start the day. First on the agenda, we go outside to do our business. Next, breakfast-time! After Iâve savored my meal, I like to go back to my bed for a cat-nap. My foster parents are both home (spoiled!) so I always have company â our day includes going for a walk, getting some cuddles, taking a nap, having some treats â then repeat, repeat, repeat. Iâm easy going so the day goes by peacefully. Weâre early dinner eaters as well, about 4 p.m., and before we know it, itâs time to relax for the evening, with just one more trip outside to do our business. If I need to go to the bathroom overnight, I know how to use a wee-wee pad, so all good there! I donât do stairs, so my cozy bed is on the first floor of the house, which is perfect! My foster parents carry me up and down the stairs if need beâ¦ Iâm such a petite girl, so itâs easy-peasy.

Living with Genesis

We feel Iâd do fine in a home either with or without other dogs. I get along with my canine friends, but I donât interact with them often. When I travel in the car (which Iâm not a particular fan of, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do), Iâm crated â my foster mom keeps me safe that way! We havenât seen me interact with cats as of yet, so weâd need to evaluate me in that situation if you have a feline family member.

Genesis Medical

I have some healthcare that Rescue Haven has been helping me with. I need a home to help continue my care.. I have an inguinal hernia, vision impairment and breast cancer,

Don't let that scare you off - you would never know that I'm sick. I'm a happy, content pup who loves life!

Genesisâ Forever Home

Iâm looking for my forever person(s), my guiding light, and whoever you are, Iâll brighten your world with my love and gentleness. Iâm easy to please, I love to love, and Iâm ready to commence my new beginning with you so we can enjoy our precious time together. Please feel out an adoption application and ask for Genesisâ¦ your gentle woman, quiet light.

1652,Adult,"Australian Cattle Dog / Blue Heeler, Beagle","Sweet Rosie is in urgent need of rescue, foster, and/or foster-to-adopt
as her current fosters need to move at the beginning of the year and their circumstances do not allow them to take her. (SEE BACKSTORY) .
Rosie is friendly and affectionate with humans and like most working dogs, she is intelligent, independent, and loves to be active. She has several favorite âjobsâ like playing fetch. She also enjoys hiking/ walking in the woods, swimming and is a good running companion, if a family member is so inclined.
Rosie has lived and bonded well with dogs who are calm and confident, but would be just as comfortable in a quiet home with a fenced in backyard and her people/ person to spend time with. Rosieâs interests and breed make her best suited in a home with young people age 10 or older as she has not had much experience with very young children. O
f course, Rosie is house trained and obedience trained. Recall is also good.

Sweet Rosie is of mixed breed and our best guess is a Red Heeler-Pocket Pittie-Beagle Mix based on her looks and her personality. She weighs 45 lbs and is approximately 6 years old. She is spayed and is current on all vaccinations.

The Back Story:
Rosie is originally from CA, where she grew up on a 100 acre ranch. Most days she would run around free on the property, co-mingling with the other dogs. Her previous owner was an environmentalist and she would often ride to work with him to join him with his outdoor research. But when her dad met his new girlfriend, and her 3 pitbulls, things started to shift. The other dogs started to bully her and soon she had to defend herself and then was given up for adoption. People who knew her took her and fostered her until their life situation no longer permitted them to have a dog. Friends drove her back to NJ and have fostered her for 10 months (they were going to foster her for 1 month.) They are now traveling to another area and cannot take more than 2 dogs that they previously owned. Paul, her sponsor, already has three rescue dogs and will lose his home if he takes another. Everyone who knows Rosie is desperately looking for a person or family to give Rosie the loving home she deserves.

1653,Young,Mixed Breed,"Finnâs Woof-Facts

Male, mixed breed, 1-year-old, 42 pounds

Stinkinâ cute!

Foster home urgently needed; also looking for forever home â preferably adult-only, dog experienced

House trained, walks well on a leash; medium energy level

Neutered, up to date on vaccines

Enjoys being around people and gets along with other dogs â best fit are dogs who are his size or larger and calm and confident

Needs fine-tuning on his behavioral skills; Rescue Haven will provide complimentary trainer

Quick introduction to Finn

Hi, Iâm Finn, the adorable boy with the infamous pouty-mouth. I promise, no Botox hereâ¦ my lips are
au naturale
. Believe me, thatâs not a frown â itâs what I call my upside-down smile, and I know Iâll be smiling for real when I find a foster home. This way, I wonât have to be in boarding anymore, and Iâll have a consistent environment and loving humans to help me along my way to find my forever home so Iâll have forever humans I can call my own. Iâm a good balance of chill and play. I really like to be with my peeps â so someone who is home often would be a good fit. I wonât keep my lips sealed on this one though â together, weâll have some work to do. My past has been inconsistent and unstable, so I need structure and training to help me acclimate to my new life, and get more comfortable and adjusted from a behavioral standpoint. You see, most times my behavior is as cute as my pout, but there are times I can do some Huckleberry Finn stuff like this:

Sometimes I simply adore people I meet, and sometimes I get a bit freaked out and barky... not a cute quality, but I'm working on trying to figure out what upsets me

I get nervous when I'm left home alone and wish for someone to help me feel safe when no one is around

My foster and forever home humans can help me overcome this, and Rescue Haven is providing a trainer at no cost to assist us. I see gold stars in our future, donât you?!?

Finnâs Background,

I did have a family at one time when I was adopted by them from a city shelter. But the people who had adopted me ended up working so many hours every day, that they werenât home enough to give me the quality of life I deserved. Rescue Haven was contacted about this and took me into their rescue to help find the right home environment for me. Since then Iâve been in a couple of temporary, short-term foster homes (but no one who could keep me long enough to give me a consistent environment), and now Iâm in boarding, as we await someone who can provide a longer-term foster home. Iâve been through a lot of changes, and some of the things I need are consistency and stability to help me feel more comfortable.

Finnâs Foster and/or Forever Home

Are you able to open your home up to me, either as a foster or forever option? Have you had a dog prior? Do you have the type of schedule that doesnât keep you out of the house too many hours each day? If you think you are a good fit based on all the info above, and would look forward to working with me on my behavioral stuff, we can learn and gain our gold stars together. Please fill out an adoption application with Rescue Haven and ask for Finn (aka Huckleberry), and I
promise that Iâll kiss you with this pouty-mouth and turn my frown into a big smile!

1654,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Brockâs Woof Facts

URGENTLY needs foster home â temp foster is no longer avail after January 1

Male, blue nose pit, 9 months old, currently 55 lbs

LOVES SO MUCH: walks, runs, smells, snuggles, dog park, car rides, people, canines, treats... THE LIST IS ENDLESS!

Tail wags with glee every time someone approaches him

Engages in âtushy-tailâ wags when meeting other dogs; enjoys playtime with canine friends

Recommend home with older children due to playfulness and mouthiness of a puppy

Crate trained and just about house broken. Stays in crate while foster mommy is at work; has free roam of house when sheâs home

Sits and waits for food like a perfect gentleman

Quick Introduction to Brock

Iâm Brock â an adorable puppy whoâs kind of like a little kid in a big-boy body (so Iâm still learning new things). On walks, I like to look at everything and everyone â I donât want to skip a beat! When Iâm in my play zone, I am focused, yet when it is time to do my business, I get that job done too. When we go outside, I have lots of energy â Iâm just a pup, but I already understand that outside means playtime, so I take advantage of every minute of it! I love treats, and I always sit and take them super gently. I enjoy playing with my toys too. When my humans are home, I like to be close by. When weâre watching TV, I like to put my paw or body part right near them. And when it gets close to bed time, I rest my head on my humanâs heart and look straight into her eyes (my foster mom says that makes her melt!).

Brockâs Background

I was sadly surrendered to a huge city shelter at only nine months old by the family that bred me in their home. It ends up that this family had too many dogs to care for which led them to giving up on little young me. Luckily, I was saved from that scary situation and became part of the Rescue Haven Foundation foster family. And, together, we walked out of that shelter rejoicing, âWe will, we will Brock youâ¦â

Brockâs Typical Day in Foster Home

I start my day in the wee-wee morning hours when my foster mom gets up (4 a.m., yikes itâs still dark outside!). Iâm really not a morning doggie, so my foster mom finds it cute when sheâs putting on my leash while Iâm yawning and stretching during the process. I get right on track though, and we take a nice walk and take care of business. Once back inside, I eat my breakfast. When Iâm done, my foster mom washes the dishes, and I sit and watch her with my paws hanging over the couch â I just want to make sure she cleans every spot of food off the plates! Then right before my foster mom leaves for work, I go in my crate with a stuffed Kong thatâs filled with either cream cheese or frozen pumpkin (OH BOY, OH BOY)! I have a dog walker who comes by twice a day and takes me out to play at the dog park. After playing with my dog walker, we come back in the house. Sometimes, I play hard-to-get about going back in my crate, but with a few bribes, I mean, treats, Iâll go right back in. When my foster mommy comes home, I get SUPER excited. She opens my crate, and I give her KISSES and HUGS. She takes me out for a walk/play time, and then I eat my dinner. A few hours later, we will go on one final walk before nighty-night. Thatâs when itâs time for her to get into bed under the covers, and I make sure to lie down right next to her, just in case she gets cold (WOOF).

Living with Brock

Iâm a puppy, so having structure, a routine and schedule work well for me. Having a couple of toys are great with me, and I especially love the doggie bones that my foster mom gets for me. I like to chew so those bones are great to have while Iâm hanging out in my doggie bed. I can be very puppy-mouthy when I get frustrated or wound up, and part of my training is helping me overcome this.

Brockâs Medical:

Iâm neutered and up-to-date on my vaccines. Although you would never realize this, I have a genetic bone disorder that caused a slight deformity in my skull, but please know that there no symptoms related to this and so long-term effects, so my hunk-of-a-head is more ready-than-ever to be close to yours.

Brockâs Forever Home

Iâm a growing, energetic puppy, so a home that can provide a daily routine/schedule, long walks, runs, playtime and continue to teach me things would be ideal. I love to be told that Iâm a good boy (and I really am a good boy, so itâs not just words). Iâll make an amazing loyal companion to my forever human. And I know itâs not all about the playing, Iâm a snuggle tank, love sac, so we can give each other warm cuddles -- with my head placed close to your heart, looking straight into your eyes and making your heart melt. If you want to make my heart melt in return, fill out an adoption application with Rescue Haven Foundation, and rejoice, âWe will, we will Brock you!â

Gets along with other dogs â especially her canine BFF named Taco

Quick introduction to Daisy

Iâm Daisy, and Iâm a pocketful of sunshine. I love kisses, pets, cuddles, tummy rubs, taking walks and playing with my toys. My most favorite place of all is lounging right in my humanâs lap â my motto: cuddle time can be anytime! I also like to share snuggles with an extra-special canine named Taco, whoâs my doggie brother from another mother. As you can tell, Iâve got a little bit of everything in this teeny-tiny body, and Iâm ready to share all of my sunshine with you.

Daisyâs Background

I was adopted through Rescue Haven Foundation about 3
, and I thought I was living the dream with my forever familyâ¦ this dream also included being with my BFF Taco (who I mentioned above). Taco and I thought all was going well, until something happened to our family structure. To our surprise, Taco and I were both returned to Rescue Haven due to no fault of our own, which has left us looking for a new family. And this time, we want to be sure that we find our true âforeverâ family.

Not only did Animal League America rescue him from the ravages of Hurricane Florence, but our top-notch veterinary staff discovered that he was suffering from orthopedic issues and a painful skin condition. He has been making a dramatic recovery here thanks to the generous donors to our Help Me Heal Program. 

Dozer faces one more challenge: he is also deaf. However, nothing can hold this boy back! Dozer has already learned hand signals for basic commands such as âCome,â âSit,â and âDown.â He responds to the âThumbs Upâ signal that means âGood Jobââ he knows that means he receives a tasty treat. This smart American Bulldog/Boxer mix is also beginning to walk nicely on a leash. 

Dozer canât wait to find a home of his own with an experienced adopter while he continues to heal. For a while, his physical activity will need to be limited. We will also be offering six (6) complimentary training sessions at our Port Washington Campus where our Pet Behaviorists will teach Dozer's adopted family how to keep him mentally and physically stimulated, and ease the transition into his new home.

Come visit our Adoption Center in Port Washington, NY, and meet Dozer today or email Ericak@animalleague.org!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43344482/1/?bust=1546356232,Dozer,43344482,M,M,A

Chaos needs a new home and a new name ? 
Chaos is a very sweet 3 1/2 year old 70lbs American Bull dog , who has spent the last 3 years outside in the yard. He deserves to become part of a family.   He is extremely affectionate and loves people. 
No one , except the neighbor , pays attention to poor Chaos.
The neighbor said he actually cries trying to get someoneâs attention. 
The owners say, that they have no time for him and are willing to surrender. 
He will be neutered and is now up to date on shots. 
He will need someone willing to help him to make an adjustment to life as a family member.   He has no experience of things and life outside the yard. He is the dog in the plastic bubble and will need someone who is willing to spend time with him and expose him to things and show him what it is like to be part of a family. 
He has not been socialized with dogs.  He hasnât been with cats 
No small children due to his size. 
For now heâs probably better as a single dog. 
Upon adoption, he will be provided with all the Free Dog Training necessary. 
Please adopt and share your life with this great guy.
Heâs desperate for it ??

1737,Adult,Mixed Breed,"Meet King. King is a big baby who just wants to love and be loved. In August of 2016, at just 3 years old, King was abandoned by his family.  Dropped at a high kill shelter, where owner surrenders can be immediately euthanized. We couldnât let that happen to this sweet young boy.  We saw his picture, this big dopey boy snuggled up at the shelter with a smaller pittie girl and we just had to save them both (see Pennyâs story too!) 
King was unsure of his new surroundings and a little nervous when he got to his foster home.  So many new sights and sounds and smells and where was his family?  Understandably, he was confused and had a tough time settling in. We donât know much about his history but we donât think Kingâs previous âfamilyâ was very nice to him.  He came to us with some quirks that led us to believe he was probably not treated very well, possibly even abused. 
King didnât really like to be crated, he wasnât great at sharing his toys, although he likes other dogs, and he was always nervous someone was going to take his food away.  As time went on and his foster mom worked with him, he came to like his crate, although he still would prefer you not stick your fingers in there and he doesnât like to be crated if he can hear that peope are home. He wants to come out and play! And he will make his typical pittie whining sounds that donât even sound like a dog. King has gotten much better at sharing toys, although he does sometimes need to be reminded to share nicely when he gets a brand new toy. What younginâ doesnât right?  King is learning, and getting better every day, at understanding that he doesnât need to worry about anything but being a dog anymore. He will sometimes still flinch when someone raises their voice or moves quickly or raises things above his head, but he is learning that nobody will hurt him anymore. 
This silly, funny, loving boy loves to play and run and be with his people.  At bedtime he happily curls up next to his foster mom and snuggles in for the night. Heâs a big snugglebug. Sometimes he forgets that heâs 100 lbs and tries to jump into your lap for some love.  He has no idea how big and powerful he really is. He walks beautifully on a leash and is not fazed by passing cars, people, or other dogs. He loves to play fetch, have his ears scratched, and play with anyone who is willing.
King is still working on building his confidence.  In the meantime, he can occasionaly (very infrequently) be nervous around new people. However, a proper intro by his foster mom quickly quells his nerves and heâs all lovebug. Heâs simply still learning that he doesnât need to be afraid anymore, that that part of his life is over. Once he sees someone he knows, King canât wait to greet them with love and kisses and hugs.  He is still learning not to jump to greet people, he just gets so excited to see his friends! He really just loves to be loved on. 
King would do best in a home with an experienced large dog owner who can play with him regularly.  He is still young and unaware of his size and still working to forget his past so a home without small children would be best. He does like other dogs but has not been around cats, but we think he would do fine with a cat given proper introduction .  His current foster home has rabbits that King regularly play bows to and canât figure out why his foster mom wonât let him play with.  (Itâs because he doesnât realize how big he is and could accidentally hurt them, but he doesnât understand that).

1744,Adult,Chihuahua,"Roger is our super star 3 year old 8lb chihuahua who came to us from an overcrowded shelter in North Jersey.  Once Roger came to his foster home it was quickly realized that he had been severely abused at the hands of a very bad person.  Roger was completely shut down and shuttered and cried when his foster Mom tried to pet him.  It has taken months for him to learn to trust again and begin the process of healing.  We call him our super star because he is now the most outgoing and friendly dog.  He loves everyone he meets including some dogs, but would proabably prefer to be the only dog.  Roger likes children, but we prefer he goes into a home with children over the age of 12.  He enjoys walks and hanging out in the backyard rolling in the grass.  If you are looking for a cuddle bug, then Roger is your man.  Every night he cuddles up under his favorite fleece blanket and sleeps.  As you can see from the pictures, he has a favorite position while underneath the blanket.  He is currently on a grain free/chicken free diet as he seems to have an allergy to them.

Her markings, like her personality, are unique and special. Jenny has cute spots â some look like freckles! And her personality is ever-engaging. She tries to talk to you. She can entertain herself home alone for 8 or 10 hours with her toys and her backyard access, but when you return she is so happy be with you. She loves walks, runs, hikes, playing fetch or tug of war, sitting while watching you cook or clean, watching TV herself (especially anything with a ball) and sleeping next to you when invited. She even likes her crate. From her crate she will watch you attentively and chew on a rawhide or other bone. 

Jenny has a super healthy stomach; she can eat anything. This medium sized, 40 pound young girl is incredibly fit and agile. Her trainer said that she would be great for agility training (a great bonding activity). She has been trained to walk well on a leash but still does best with experienced handlers as she is quite active and strong. We tested her DNA and she is Swiss shepherd (a herding dog), pit and Rottie, although she really doesnât look like any of those breeds. We recommend her as an only pet. But she is very good on a leash walking next to dogs that she likes. 

Jenny is fully housebroken, knows her basic commands, is spayed, up to date on all her shots and ready to be your loyal family pet! Recommended for kids over 12 or active adults. Jenny is a rare gem!

She is so willing to please, that she will do anything for pets. And you will never catch Rumor without a smile on her face, nothing can bring this happy girl down! The one thing that makes her happier than anything in the world is children. She is in a home with a one year old and she plays so exceptionally well with her, that we know Rumor is a child lover through and through!

Rumor was found as a stray in the middle of a very busy city, so she was taken to a high kill shelter. She stayed there for a few weeks before we met her and fell in love with her goofy smile. While she was at the shelter she was a favorite of the managers there, and they chose her for training classes, and for adoption events. At one event she got a cut on her tail and it took forever to heal because her tail never stops wagging! Thats just a side affect of being so happy all the time! Rumor loves to chase tennis balls, throw her favorite rope toy around in the air and chase it, and play with other dogs. Did we mention she loves to run, swim and play in water? That is her favorite thing to do other than being loved on by her foster mom. Because of that we are requiring her forever family have a yard, or be avid joggers. We owe that to Rumor.

Rumor's bright amber eyes will draw you in and melt your heart. When she goes on walks with her foster mom people stop and pet her, and even though sheis a solid 55 pounds, nobody is intimidated because she has an infectious smile. This love bug is crate trained, house broken, up to date on shots, spayed, and on heartworm preventative. She adores children and would do fine in a home with kids of all ages. If this girl sounds like the perfect pet for your family, please apply!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42316377/1/?bust=1546350854 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42316377/2/?bust=1546350868 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/42316377/3/?bust=1546350884,Rumor,42316377,F,L,A
1765,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Pit Bull Terrier","Meet Merry! This beautiful girl is a perfect mix of staffordshire bull terrier and labrador. She has all the great qualities of both breeds, which means she is the perfect family pet! Plus she is still young, at only 9 months, which means she is trainable, submissive, and playful.

Merry was found at the Memphis animal shelter after she was picked up as a stray. We think she was someones dog that was dumped because she wasn't skinny and her fur was so shiny! Merry also knew commands as soon we said them, so she was once loved, and we promised her she would find a loving family again.

Merry is about 40 pounds, but will probably be closer to 50 when fully grown. She is gentle, sweet, and super smart. Merry is submissive with other dogs, and doesn't have an aggressive bone in her body, even when she is eating or playing with a toy! She is crate trained and house broken, and is food motivated. That means she will learn all sorts of commands and tricks as long as she gets rewarded with a treat! Merry has been around a few cats on walks and acts interested in them, but didn't try to chase them when they ran - thats huge for a puppy!

Merry is spayed, up to date on her shots, and heartworm negative. She is a super puppy that is going to develope into a super dog! she is crate trained and house broken, good on a leash, good in a car, and a cuddler. She is also available for adoption and will be in New Jersey January 4th, so put in your applications now so you can have her as soon as she is available!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43610116/1/?bust=1546350853 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43610116/2/?bust=1546350872 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43610116/3/?bust=1546350882,Merry,43610116,F,M,A
1766,Adult,"American Staffordshire Terrier, Labrador Retriever","Meet Mallie! This beautiful 40 pound blonde girl is the epitome of a lap dog- she will do anything to be with her person, on top of her person, giving love to her person. Mallie is an incredibly loving dog that will be happy with anyone who has unconditional love for her, with an endless number of pets and kisses.

Mallie was rescued from the Memphis Animal Shelter where she as picked up as a stray. One of our volunteers met her, fell in love with her, and took her home as a foster dog. In her foster home Mallie has gotten so much love and attention. We she is completely house broken and crate trained!

Mallie has the saddest, most soulful eyes, and that just adds to her adorable face and precious personality. Mallie is not a high energy dog, and she's about 2 years old, so she is out of the puppy, destructive stage, but she is a great family pet. She would love a mom or dad (or both!) that like to watch Netflix for hours and needs a furry companion to complete their family.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43618035/1/?bust=1546350861 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43618035/2/?bust=1546350867 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43618035/3/?bust=1546350883,Mallie,43618035,F,M,A
1767,Young,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Meet Georgia! This gorgeous 45 pound 10 month old baby has had an incredibly rough life. She was used to breed as an outside dog before she was taken by an animal control officer to the local kill shelter. One of our volunteers was walking the rows of kennels at the shelter and immediately fell in love with Georgia's sad eyes. When we took Georgia out of that shelter for the last time, she was so happy and relieved, she took a long, deep, uninterrupted sleep. 

Georgia has soft, beautiful fur and biggest softest ears. She loves to be petted and lay on her persons' lap, getting the affection and attention she deserves. Georgia is still a puppy, so playing outside or chewing on her toys is a must! And boy does Georgia like toys! She can spend hours chewing on her squeaky toys, or bones, and gets so excited when her Bark Box comes in! She is quite adorable as she goes through the toy box finding the perfect toy to chew on. 

Georgia is in a foster home with other dogs (one big and one small) and three cats, and she has no issue with either. She is submissive and loves other dogs, and is great with all animals of all sizes. She is also a master walker, and when she goes on long walks with her foster mom, she goes without a leash! Georgia is an obedient girl who is so easy to train because she will do anything to make her foster mom and dad proud of her. 

Georgia is almost done with heartworm treatment and will be ready to bbe adopted January 5th. She is spayed, up to date on her shots, and healthy.

Willis is a typical puppy - he is playful, happy, sweet, and submissive. He is in a home with a lot of small dogs (chihuahuas, maltese, etc) and he is so good with them! Willis knows his boundaries and doesn't hurt the smaller dogs, and he is a great big brother to the little puppies in his foster home.

Willis is neutered, house broken, and ready to find his forever home. He is up to date on his shots, heartworm negative, and although he still has minor hair loss from his life before we rescued him, he is very a very healthy, very happy boy. Willis is a great dog that is going to make a great family pet. He knows how to use a doggy door to go outside and potty, and is great in a crate.

1769,Young,Labrador Retriever,"Meet Beatrice! This beautiful, all black, stunning beauty, is a 40-45 pound small lab. Although a pure bred lab is almost double her size, Beatrice (also known as Bea) acts and looks like a typical lab, just in a much more compact size! 

Bea is 18-24 months old, and is super smart. She is also a lover, who has the best time with her foster mom, and goes everywhere with her. Beatrice is an exceptional car rider and leash walker, and gives the best kisses to anyone who pays any attention to her. She was an owner surrender at the local kill shelter, and when one of our volunteers met her, we knew we had to save her and find her an amazing home. In her foster home Bea has proven herself to be house broken, crate trained, non destructive, and a playful girl!

Bea loves going to the dog park and meeting dogs of all sizes. She is truly submissive and will roll over when she meets new dogs to show them that she is no threat. She is an excitable girl that knows commands, but she is happy or excited, she forgets all her training! Her tail constantly wags because she is super happy to be out of the shelter and into a home where she is getting the love she deserves.

1770,Young,Labrador Retriever,"Meet the one and only Hazel Grace! This beautiful, sleek, all black girl is a typical labrador. She is long legged, big eared, super smart, and very obedient. She isn't a purebred lab, but she is pretty dang close!

Hazel Grace was found at the Memphis Animal Shelter after she was picked up as a stray running the streets. She was so skinny you could see every bone in her body, so we know she was on the street for a long time. We rescued her, took her to a foster home, and showed her what it was like to be a loved member of a family. And boy has Hazel Grace enjoyed it!

This beautiful 50 pound girl is a lot more stunning than her photos show. She has the shiniest, smoothest fur and the biggest brown eyes. And she is super soft to pet, and is a perfect lap dog to anyone with a lap! Hazel Grace loves other dogs and kids, and is such a gentle soul we think she would be great with cats. She is also incredibly smart, like most labs are, and loves water! Hazel Grace is wonderful on a leash, a terrific car rider, and loves her crate.

1771,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Meet Frannie! This beautiful silver two year old staffy mix is a very sweet girl who has learned most of her basic commands - sit, stay (for a treat) and drop it. And she learned it within a few weeks in her foster home! Her foster parents are still working on a few other commands, so when Frannie gets adopted she is going to be the smartest rescue ever!

Frannie is good with other dogs and is not aggressive in any way. She is currently in a foster home with two other dogs and plays with them at their own pace then relaxes on her dog bed with a toy to occupy her time. Frannie is also good with the cats in her home. She is not cat aggressive, but dearly wants to play with them, so if she goes to a home with cats, they need to be dog savvy!

Frannie also enjoys snuggling with her foster parents at night after a long day of playing with her foster siblings, and can play with children for hours! She's around kids older than ten and loves them, and we think she will do well with kids younger than ten, but she might knock them over trying to get in their laps and give them kisses! Frannie is heartworm negative, spayed, up to date on her shots, and ready for her forever home to find her!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43507000/1/?bust=1546350856 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43507000/2/?bust=1546350873 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43507000/3/?bust=1546350875,Frannie,43507000,F,M,A
1772,Adult,Dutch Shepherd,"Meet Cleveland! This beautiful big brindle boy has all of the great qualities a family looks for in a dog; he's mild mannered, great with kids and the elderly, calm, house broken, and super sweet. Cleveland is a little over 55 pounds, with long shepherd fur and big beautiful eyes.

Cleveland was found at a local shelter and he was going crazy in his kennel. You see, Cleveland doesn't like enclosed spaces, and has anxiety about it. But that is literally his only fault, as he is near a perfect dog as you will find otherwise. Cleveland is so good on walks he doens't even need a leash, doesn't mess with any animals he sees, and loves the car! In fact we think Cleveland would be a perfect dog for someone with PTSD or other social ailments.

Cleveland is neutered, up to date on his shots, and chipped. He is everyone's best friend and a social butterfly. But Cleveland is not high energy, which is a normal characteristc of Dutch Shepherds. In fact he's pretty low energy and just wants to live where ever his person is. Cleveland is in Northern New Jersey working with a trainer daily to make him the perfect dog for his new family, so if you want to meet this beautiful boy and make him a member of your family, please apply!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43658169/1/?bust=1546350861 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43658169/2/?bust=1546350864 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43658169/3/?bust=1546350877,Cleveland,43658169,M,L,A

Gracie Lou was found at the local kill shelter after she was found as a stray, skin and bones, barely able to do much besides wag her tail. She was at the shelter for two weeks, gaining weight, being safe, and gaining confidence when we found her. We took her outside to play and she stole our hearts immediately. Regardless of her past and how she was treated, Gracie Lou has the best outlook on life and the best, most loving personality.

Gracie Lou is in a foster home in Bergen county NJ with numerous other dogs and she loves them, big and small. She is a great playmate and very social with all dogs and kids she comes across. She has gained about 10-12 pounds since rescued her and is roughly 45-50 pounds. She is microchipped, house broken, crate trained, and spayed.

neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, heartworm-negative, and is current on
heartworm prevention as well as flea & tick prevention. It takes him a bit to warm up to new people, but when he does, he is very sweet! He really loves his belly-rubs and going for rides in the car!

1783,Adult,Pekingese,"(ADOPTED) The encounter with Evil in everyday life was little Masonâs experience early on. Mason found himself in a situation, through no fault of his own, with very sick
and cruel owners. A true Evil Encounter. Delighting in how pathetic the cruelty
makes the dog appear. Mason was seized by the NYPD after his horrific situation was reported. Mason arrived at the NYSPCA in November
2016. His overall condition was one of the worst cases of cruelty ever seen by
the organization. Mason required numerous surgeries for perineal tumor, stones (bleeding from penis), removal of solid objects in stomach, inferior lid ectropion/
lagophtalmos in both eyes, etc.

Masonâs very sweet and positive attitude made him a delight to care for during this time. Just a side note, Mason is the only dog I have known who wags his tail while receiving his eye meds from me. Mason will require eye meds and a special diet for the rest of his life. PRNI was called in February 2017 and asked if we would take Mason. Of course we would take Mason. His former owners had been found guilty in court of cruelty. Mason was now legally allowed to find a new owner. 

Mason has now received surgery for his eyes, paid by PRNI. We have spent over
$3000 but our Mason is worth it. Every cent. Surgery was a complete success
performed by Dr. Holmberg, a true miracle worker. A New Jersey  opthamologist surgeon.

Structurally, Mason is indicative of good breeding. His temperament is such that
supports coming from well-bred lineage. Perhaps Mason was just a victim
of his breeder not really checking out a puppy owner. Hasty placement perhaps.
Mason is not a puppy mill breeding. Just a well-bred little Peke that had fallen
through the cracks. Adoption fee:  $500

Mason is laying at my feet as I write. Hopefully the memories of the Evil Mason has encountered in his life will pass. I pray so.
Please join the Pekingese Rescue Network, Inc. to combat the Evil that
the little homeless Pekingese continue to encounter. Your gifts are so needed. Help us to help them.

1802,Adult,Pit Bull Terrier,"Garden City, Long Island - IVY - 4 years old, 53 lbs, Needs Solo Dog Home

Ivy is available for adoption! 

Spring has sprung! The roses, tulips and magnolia are all about to bloom but we're really excited about Ivy, our gorgeous, goofy, grey and white girl. We think Ivy must be part love bug because she is soooooo sweet and people are her favorite thing in this world. Like maybe even more than treats and bones. 

While Ivy's got a 24/7 grin now we rescued her right in time from a shelter that doesn't make any dog smile when they think about it. But thank goodness we did because she's dreaming of her forever home where she gets to give her humans tons of love and get lots of loving right back. We think Ivy would be best as the only dog in the house for now. And while spring flings sound fun, Ivy's love doesn't just last all year round but forever in fact.  So come meet amazing Ivy today. 

Ivy is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. If you would like to meet Ivy, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414.

1803,Young,"Labrador Retriever, Pointer","Meet Miss Winnie! 
Winnie is a 2 year old lab/pointer mix.  She's happy to co-exist with dogs, kids, and cats. She loves playing with her 2 foster siblings and human siblings.  She is crate and leash trained, but is truly a lab/pointer mix and has a big hunting nose that will lead her to any smell!  She will need an active family who can take her running or for long walks in the park every day.  Because she's a little nervous at first, we think she'd be best outside the city!  (We will consider families inside the city with experience with large dogs/high energy homes).

For immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.

 Our adoption fee is $475. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, 30 days of pet insurance, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.
 
Our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public.  Each dog is placed in an Oklahoma foster home where it is kept for a minimum of 2 weeks for quarantine to ensure that if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment.  After the 2-week quarantine, they are spayed/neutered and fully vetted.  Once that is completed, the dog is transported via ground or air to a foster  home in the NJ/NY area.  However, if you are interested in any of our dogs and do not live within the mentioned areas, please contact us as transport can be arranged to approved adopters living outside these areas.  Thank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43294617/1/?bust=1542224978 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43294617/2/?bust=1542226418,Winnie,43294617,F,M,A
1804,Young,Australian Cattle Dog / Blue Heeler,"Are you looking for a dog to have fun with? Meet Brando! Brando is a neutered 4 year old cattle dog mix. He has a striking speckled coat of white and chocolate and weighs about 60 pounds. He loves people and after a walk, jog, swim or hike he would be content to snuggle on the couch. He knows how to play and also likes to show affection. 

He was an absolute champion going through heartworm treatment and the vetâs office fell in love with the big goofball. He has been very tolerant of all vetting. He also is quick to jump in the bath tub and would probably enjoy a soak wherever he can find it. 

He is crate trained, house trained, enjoys the car, and LOVES toys!! Bones, squeak toys, puzzles...you name it he wants to play with it. 
 		
Brando would do best as an only pet and prefers the company of humans. No cats for Brando! His size and energy would be best in a house with older children and adults. He is eager to learn basic obedience with his new family. 

Brando is located in Perkasie, PA. For questions, please contact 		hannah.case@gmail.com 

Brando is up to date on vetting, micro-chipped, and ready to find his family.

1805,Baby,Labrador Retriever,"Hi, Iâm Charlie D. Iâm a 3-month-old, 15 lb Black Lab mix puppy. I love to play with other dogs, but Iâm super gentle! Iâm also good with kids and I havenât been introduced to cats yet, but my current caretakers think Iâll get along just fine with them. Just like all puppies, Iâm still learning the ropes and need help with my training â Iâm doing well with potty-training by using pee pads and doing great with my leash training, but still working on a few kinks with my manners (what puppy isnât?!). Iâm pretty laidback so crate-training should be an easy learning curve. Iâm a puppy so just remember that Iâll require lot of attention, but I have a lot of love to give and canât wait to find my forever home.

1806,Young,"Chihuahua, Rat Terrier","Hi there, my name is Amber! Iâm a 1 year old, 7.5 lb Chihuahua mix. Iâm a quiet and shy nugget with a sassy, mean mugging look. Due to my tiny size, Iâd prefer to be adopted into a household with adults or older children. I love other dogs and Iâm looking for a family that can provide me with other doggie sibling(s) and patience to welcome me into their home. Iâm a bit timid and need time to warm up to humans, but with patience and gentle care, my real personality shines through â I am curious, sweet and once I open up, Iâll give licks and look for pets, attention and treats! My ideal home would give me time inside with a chill and calm space to feel safe enough to open up and let my real personality and mean mugging look shine through. Not to mention, Iâm pretty smart â Iâm house trained, crate trained / play pen trained, leash trained and even pee pad trained!

We ended up at a shelter)o; Thank goodness for some really nice, caring people who helped us to safety right away! I did the very best I could and all three pups are doing great!! They even found homes of their own! Now it's MY turn, I'm small.... only about 40lbs and really just want time to run and play and be a pup myself. I heard the vet say I was about 2 yrs old and that I will be getting spayed soon so I don't have to have any more babies. I have been vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped as well. All set for my forever family, so now it's time!! My temporary foster mom says I'm a sweetheart and anyone would be lucky to have me in their life. I am house broken and crate trained. I also LOVE my toys and bones(o; I adore children too! Please help me to find my forever family!!

1828,Senior,Poodle,"Please note: We are NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS on Pinky Lee at this time.

Pinky Lee was dumped at a very large, inner city shelter. Reason for being turned in was â could not stand, drinking excessive amounts of water, and urinating excessively.â Needless to say at approximately ten years old, this poor little girl had never been to a vet. She was in need of total grooming and veterinary care.
After several weeks at the shelter, the medical staff diagnosed Pinky Lee with diabetes. She is currently on insulin two times daily. We are working on getting her diabetes under control. She is unable to be spayed at this time due to her diabetes and has mammary gland tumors which could be benign.

At ten pounds and possibly ten years old, Pinky Lee is an adorable little girl. She just wants to be near her human while you watch your favorite tv show, read a book, or take a nap. She loves to be carried like a pampered pup but also loves going for a walk. She adores  going outside and is totally housebroken. Pinky Lee ignores the resident dog and cats in her foster home.

1837,Adult,Mixed Breed,"This cute little guy is looking for his forever family. Winston became part of FOWA when a call came in, that he was scheduled to be euthanized because his owners didn't want to deal with his diabetes and blindness caused by the diabetes being left untreated for so long . He was only 4 we couldn't let him die so we quickly took him in .  

It took some time to control his diabeties and get him ready for his eye surgery. That day has come, and Winston is no longer blind. Seeing how he is enjoying his new world is priceless! He is a happy little fella (22lbs), about 4 years old. His foster parents have a 20 year old cat which he gets along great with. Winston is neutered, micro chipped, house and crate trained and up to date with all his shots. 

He has been living condo life with his foster parents. He loves going on long walks and is great on the leash. He can be picky with some dogs, especially hyper ones. Winston is very loveable. He likes to cuddle on the couch and watch tv. He warms up quicker to woman than men. Winston would do best in a home with no small children. 

Because of the diabetes, he needs to be on prescription food. And injectable insulin and eye drops need to be administered daily. All simple things that he does we ease ... 

Winston just knows there is a family that will look beyond a few medical issues and see in him what we all did .. A sweet boy who had a bad break and he now deserves his happy tail ..

1848,Adult,"Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd Dog","Stella was a stray that was never claimed, however, she was once someone's beloved pet.  We know this by just how attached she is to humans, by how she is reliably housebroken she is and her overall behavior.  Stella demands attention and to always be pet by ""mouthing"" you.  That means Stella will take your hand in her mouth to encourage you to pet her, this is in no way a form of aggression, rather a desperate plea for your attention.  While we estimate Stella to be somewhere around 8 yrs old, she is in very good health and still very active and playful.  She loves to fling a toy around.  Stella is fully vetted and ready to be a part of a family again, please don't let her sit in a shelter.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43021808/1/?bust=1539604056,Stella,43021808,F,M,A
1849,Baby,Pit Bull Terrier,"Chanelâs puppies were born in their foster home on Oct. 13, and now theyâre ready to go to their forever homes!

Theyâre the perfect blend of playful and cuddly. They look up at you with those gorgeous eyes and your heart canât help but melt.
Being so young, these babies will need to go to homes that have the time and patience to train and socialize them properly. Theyâll need playtime and potty breaks at least every two hours in the beginning. Puppies are a huge commitment, but the payoff is amazing!

1866,Adult,Pomeranian,"Please read the listing completely prior to filling out an application for Chase. Please note, we receive hundreds of applications each week for our rescues, and do our best to respond to everyone, but it is not always possible. The best way to be considered for adoption is to fill out an application, we do not contact references until after speaking with you.

To fill out an application, please visit:

www.popuppaws.com/pages/application

*Please also note, in instances when a dog has received an overwhelming amount of applications, we will share with applications similar dogs in foster care that are becoming available soon.

Details:
Age (estimated)- 2 years old
Sex: Male
Breed (estimated)- Pomeranian mix - he looks like a pure Pomeranian but is larger at 15 pounds.
Color/Markings: Tan
Current weight (approximate): 15 pounds
Health summary: No known issues. Neutered. Up-to-date on distemper and rabies vaccinations. 
Adoption fee: $595 - Please note, animals that receive larger volume of applications have a higher adoption fee to offset the enormous cost of the many medically urgent animals in our care.

Description: Have you ever seen a dog with a bigger smile than Chase? His smile just about sums him up. Heâs an energetic, happy-go-lucky young guy. Heâs also extremely gorgeous, and He is extremely playful and affectionate, but he also loves laying by your side. He is fully housebroken, and loves his walks. He was surrendered when his owner was moving, who we believe was using him for breeding, as he was rescued with a young puppy that was said to be his (which will be available for adoption soon as well). Chase gets along well with other dogs, but he needs to be introduced to them slowly and with patience, as he gets very excited and instantly goes into play mode. The same applies to cats. He loves his foster, and happily waits for him by the window when hes out, and welcomes him with a big hello when heâs back. He is crate trained, and currently sleeps well in his crate overnight. Heâs a great dog, that would benefit from proper training to channel his energy (as most dogs do), but he is not destructive and very friendly. If you are interested in meeting him, please fill out an application, or contact us if you would like to be notified when his puppy become available.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43409279/1/?bust=1543514333 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43409279/2/?bust=1543514335 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43409279/3/?bust=1543514337 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43409279/4/?bust=1543514341 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43409279/5/?bust=1543514343 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/43409279/6/?bust=1545156218,Chase,43409279,M,S,A

1876,Young,Pit Bull Terrier,"Our sweet Bella. Our first dog we rescued from a life on the streets in Newark. She is the sweetest dog you will ever meet! She does become overstimulated and can become a little nippy as she needs to learn trust and boundaries. She will need a patient and committed adopter to work with her correctable issues. She has shown no aggression, we just feel she never learned the proper way to play and needs a firm handler to show her the appropriate way. She needs that guidance and confidence to become the dog she is meant to be! She did live with a 3 yr old in foster however, we prefer a home with children 12 and up. She gets along with male dogs so a meet would be required.

While living in the city he was stressed out and didnât handle it very well. He was becoming leery of strangers, but now that he has been working with a trainer he is more focused and confident- Now heâs living in Stamford with tons of room to run around. Heâs very dog friendly so heâs spending his days romping around with other dogs. 

Cooper would do best in a home with other dogs (we would not recommend a home with younger children) although he did live with teenagers -

We are looking for a new owner who understands the breed and has experience with Shepards - He is a very loyal dog who bonds quickly- He is very characteristic of a Shepard and will make a good watch dog- 

 He comes with A+ training and a trainer who will commit to working with you (lessons for free) when you adopt him. The trainer is in Stamford CT where Cooper is currently residing-

Coco also loves the beach and will run right in the waves and  loves to dig in the sand she can be very playful but sleeps very well.

Zara is available for adoption now from Ruff House Rescue... Bring Zara Home for the Holidays! Ruff House Rescue ""Goes Big"" so more pets have a chance to go home. This means we are rescuing in areas that we can make the biggest lifesaving impact. While we continue to help our local dogs and families in NY wanting to surrender their pets we are compelled to help the animals most in need from the highest kill rate shelters in the country and the highest statistic for strays. Hundreds and thousands of highly adoptable puppies and dogs are killed daily. Therefore the majority of our pets come from these areas. This means the cost of rescue is higher due to the high costs of vetting, boarding, and transport. Please note our adoption fees vary and are the most reliable source of revenue enabling us to continue our rescue efforts. Your adoption fees directly contribute to the rescue of these animals. Please see our website for information and an application to adopt or foster or volunteer for RHR. Adoption fees vary from $250 to $500 which includes a pets spay/neuter - Micro-chipping - current vaccinations - heartworm testing.

1994,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"20 Feb 2017: 

She was really shy and flinched (is that the right word? still working on my english) sometimes when touched or when there were loud noises. Did she get hit before?
But she loves getting treats and tried to crawl into my treat bag When I sat down with her and gave her treats she came into my lap.
Taking pictures was a little difficult, she either tried to eat my camera (at least she thought it was a treat) or wanted to walk somewhere else.

 

 

10 Feb 2017: Ophelia was crated 24/7 outside in a driveway. She is 1.5 years old and 39 pounds She was so scared when rescue arrived to change her life, sleeping in a cage in her own fecal and urine. Her owner failed to check on her and a good Samaritan decided it was time to help this baby, who was being trained to dog fight. She show signs of having a litter of pups, but no pups were around to be found. Ophelia is scared and will need time to be loved and to trust humans again.

 

25 Feb 2017 : 

in my opinion ophelia warmed up between monday and friday. she was much more confident and less frightened outside. she even rolled around on the grass for some belly rubs. so if someone takes a little time with her, she is the sweetest and friendlies t mama. 
i had no issues taking something she was not supposed to eat out of her mouth.
she walks very good on the leash. i'm just not sure, if she knows commands. she waits, if you stop walking, but ""sit"" does not seem to be in her repertoire. as friendly and treat motivated as she is, it should be no problem to work with her.",http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41359746/1/?bust=1546360669 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41359746/2/?bust=1546360849 http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41359746/3/?bust=1546360974,Ophelia (OS),41359746,F,M,A
1995,Adult,American Staffordshire Terrier,"If interested, please fill out an application at www.nycsecondchancerescue.org.30 Jan 2018: 

Hank is a big-headed, low-rider who loves everyone he meets. His reaction to meeting new people is adorable â his whole chunky body wiggles along with his wagging tail.

Hank is playful but not hyper. He likes walks, treat puzzles, and just goofing around. Hank is extremely smart and learns more commands every day. He is quite food motivated so the possibilities are endless!

Hank also loves playing with other medium-to-large dogs. He has a pretty forward play style so other dogs in the home would need to be ok with that. No cats for Hank.

Hank adores kids. But he is a big boy and at times can be a bit of a bull-in-a-china shop so a family with young kids would not be the best fit for him.

Hank is about 5 and weighs 84 lbs. He is neutered and up-to-date on shots.
